    "If we compare the data type of each column to its contents, several opportunities for data cleaning can be seen. For example, the \"normalized-losses\" feature is listed as an object-type column because it contains both strings and numbers. However, the strings in the column are question marks (?). Rather than being categories, these may be placeholders for missing data. This problem applies to several other columns, not just this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in some columns like \"num-of-doors\", numbers are written as words. For example, 2 is written as \"two\". Since the numbers are in string format, these cannot be used in the K Nearest Neighbors model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Replace question mark strings (\"?\") with null values (NaN). These are the proper way to indicate missing values.\n",
