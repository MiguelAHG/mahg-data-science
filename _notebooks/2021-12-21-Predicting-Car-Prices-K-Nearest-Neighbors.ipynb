    "K Nearest Neighbors or KNN is an an algorithm that can make predictions based on the similarity between different observations. In this project, I used KNN to predict the price of a car based on how similar its features are to those of other cars. Towards this end, I applied various machine learning techniques, such as standardization, feature selection, train-test split, hyperparameter optimization, and k-fold cross validation."

    "If we compare the data type of each column to its contents, several opportunities for data cleaning can be seen. For example, the \"normalized-losses\" feature is listed as an object-type column because it contains both strings and numbers. However, the strings in the column are question marks (?). Rather than being categories, these may be placeholders for missing data. This problem applies to several other columns, not just this one.\n",

    "## Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth technique is hyperparameter optimization. This involves training the KNN model using different hyperparameter values to see which one performs the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperparameter is a value that influences the behavior of a model and has no relation to the data. In the case of KNN, one important hyperparameter is the $k$ value, or the number of neighbors used to make a prediction. If $k = 5$, we take the mean price of the top five most similar cars and call this our prediction. However, if $k = 10$, we take the top ten cars, so the mean price may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can optimize $k$ in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide values of $k$ to test.\n",
    "- For each $k$ value, fit and evaluate a KNN model.\n",
    "- Identify the best-performing model and use its $k$ value in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate a model, we need an evaluation metric. In our case, we will use the Root Mean Squared Error or RMSE. This is calculated with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\text{actual}_i - \\text{predicted}_i)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "- $\\text{actual}$ is the actual target value, or in this case, the actual price of a car.\n",
    "- $\\text{predicted}$ is the predicted target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE can be interpreted as the average error of a regression model. For example, if $RMSE = 1000$, this means that the model's predicted car prices are USD 1000 away from the actual car prices, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of hyperparameter optimization using RMSE. All of the numeric features were used for this example."

    "The last technique that will be discussed is K-Fold Cross-Validation. Earlier, we split the data into one training set and one testing set. The K-Fold Cross-Validation allows us to obtain a more holistic view of model performance by rotating the observations used in the two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $k$ has a different meaning. It determines the number of splits to make in a dataset. For example, if $k = 5$, the dataset will be split into 5 sets, each set containing 20% of the total data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the data into 5 sets: A, B, C, D, E.\n",
    "- Use set A as the testing set and use the others as the training set.\n",

    "- Compute the mean RMSE value. This is the final metric of model performance.\n",
