    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm is a machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem. It calculates the probability that an event $B$ occurred given that event $A$ occurred. Thus, it is usually used in classification problems. (Vadapalli, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use the algorithm to determine the probability that a message is spam given its contents. We will then use this probability to decide whether to treat new messages as spam or not. For example, if the probability of being spam is over 50%, then we may treat the message as spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying spam is important in the Philippines because phishing campaigns went up by 200% after the pandemic began (Devanesan, 2020), and a telecommunications provider recently had to block around 71 million spam messages (Yap, 2021). Such messages may attempt to steal personal information, steal money from an account, or install malware (FTC, 2020). Thus, machine learning can be a very helpful tool in preventing such harm from occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the algorithm can be easily implemented using existing functions such as those in the [`scikit-learn` package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#multinomial-naive-bayes), I will manually code the algorithm step-by-step in order to explain the mathematical intuition behind it."

    "These two formulas are identical except for the $Spam$ or $Ham$ event. Let us just look at the first equation to unpack it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of event $B$ given that event $A$ has happened can be represented as $P(B|A)$ (\"probability of B given A\"). Thus, the left side of the formula, $P(Spam|w_1, w_2, \\dots , w_n)$, represents the probability of spam given the contents of a message. Each variable $w_i$ represents one word in the message. For example, $w_1$ is the first word in the message, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle, the \"directly proportional to\" sign ($\\propto$) is used instead of the equals sign. The left and right sides are not equal, but one increases as the other increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the right side, $P(Spam)$ simply refers to the probability that any message is spam. It can be calculated as the number of spam messages in the dataset over the total number of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the formula ends with $\\Pi_{i=1}^n P(w_i|Spam)$. The $P(w_i|Spam)$ part refers to the probability of a certain word occurring given that the message is known to be spam. We must calculate this probability for each word in the message. Then, because the uppercase pi ($\\Pi$) refers to a product, we must multiply the word probabilities together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additive Smoothing and Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate $P(w_i|Spam)$, we need to use the following formula:\n",

    "$P(w_i | Spam) = \\frac{N_{w_i | Spam} + \\alpha}{N_{Spam} + \\alpha \\cdot N_{Vocabulary}}$\n",

    "$\\alpha$ is the **additive smoothing parameter**. We will use $\\alpha = 1$. This is added to the numerator to prevent it from becoming zero. If it does become zero, the entire product in the main formula will become zero.\n",

    "In this case, $B_1$ is the event that the message is non-spam, and $B_2$ is the event that it is spam. $B$ can refer to either $B_1$ or $B_2$, depending on which probability we want to calculate. Also, $A$ refers to the specific contents of one message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make things clearer, let us say that $Spam$ is the event that the message is spam, and $Ham$ is the event that the message is non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, let us expand event $A$ (the message itself) in order to consider the individual words inside it. For example, the first word in a message can be labeled $w_1$. If we have a total of $n$ words, then the words can be labeled as $w_1, w_2, \\dots , w_n$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the denominators are the same. Since we only want to compare these two probabilities, we can skip calculating the denominator and just calculate the numerators.

    "\n",
    "If we make the assumption that the probability of each word is independent of the probability of the other words, we can use the multiplication rule. The assumption of independence is what makes the algorithm \"naive,\" as it usually doesn't hold true in reality. However, the algorithm is still useful for predictions despite this.\n",
