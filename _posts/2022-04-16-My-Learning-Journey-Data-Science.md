Welcome to my timeline of my data science learning journey.

# How I started studying data science

I first found out about data science in March 2020, around the time that the COVID-19 pandemic started. I decided to take online courses about data science in the summer, in order to see if it was interesting. First, I took the Python Core, Data Science, and Machine learning courses on [Sololearn](https://sololearn.com).

Here, I learned basic skills in Python, the Spyder IDE, Jupyter Noteboook, SQL basics, and Python packages such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

# Data Science in Practical Research

When school started again in September 2020, I was able to apply my data science skills in my project for Practical Research class. My group's research paper was entitled "The Effect of COVID-19's Consequences on Philippine Frontliners on their Mental Health: A Descriptive, Correlational Study." We collected survey responses from 196 frontliners. I wrote the entire analysis in Python, from data cleaning to transformation to modeling.

I had to learn new things in order to do this, including:

- Statsmodels, a statistical package in Python
- Dummy-coding categorical variables
- Multiple linear regression
- Testing the assumptions of OLS regression
- Interpreting model results

# Dataquest Online Platform

From May 2021 to April 2022, I studied the Data Scientist in Python (DSP) career path on [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io). The courses included many guided projects in Jupyter Notebook, some of which have been posted on my blog.

Read more about what I learned from the DSP path in this [blog post](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/online-course-dataquest-data-scientist-in-python/).

# 2021 Project SPARTA Butuan City Open Data Challenge

I led a team to participate in this competition from June to November of 2021. I developed agriHanda, an agricultural disaster risk dashboard for Butuan City, Philippines. For this, we won the Second Placer award and Best in Ingenious Solution award.
