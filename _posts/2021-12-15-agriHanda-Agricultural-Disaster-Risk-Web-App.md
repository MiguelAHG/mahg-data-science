# Overview

On November 12, 2021, the [Project SPARTA Recognition Ceremony](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=402923554635179) took place. In the Open Data Challenge for Butuan City, my team's web app was awarded as Second Placer and Best in Ingenious Solution.

In this post, I will talk about the web app and my experience working on the project, reflect on my output's strengths and points for improvement, and discuss the data science skills that I honed along the way.
