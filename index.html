# Hi, I'm Migs Germar.

Welcome to my data science blog. Here, I upload my project notebooks, as well as posts about recent achievements. Feel free to explore my posts below. Important posts have been pinned to the top and marked with \[ðŸ“Œ\]. I recommend starting with [My Portfolio Projects](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/my-portfolio-projects), which lists my best works.

You can also navigate using [Search](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/search/) and [Tags](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/categories/). For my contact information, visit the [About Me](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/about/) page.

Thanks for visiting!
