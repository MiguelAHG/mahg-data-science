Hi, I'm Migs Germar.

Welcome to my data science blog. Here, I upload my project notebooks in order to show my learning journey and the skills that I have gained along the way.
Eventually, I will select several of my best projects and pin them to the top as my portfolio works.
Until then, feel free to explore my existing projects. Click them below, or use the search bar.

Thanks for visiting!
