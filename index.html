# Hi, I'm Migs Germar.

Welcome to my data science blog. Here, I upload my project notebooks in order to showcase my data science skills. For an overview of my learning journey, visit the [About Me](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/about/) page.

Eventually, I will select several of my best projects and pin them to the top of this page as my portfolio works. Until then, feel free to explore my existing projects below. You can also navigate using [Search](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/search/) and [Tags](https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/categories/).

Thanks for visiting!
