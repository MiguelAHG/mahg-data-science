            "title": "Basic Statistics with Fandango Movie Ratings",
            "content": "Unsplash | Alex Litvin Overview . Fandango is a website that sells tickets for movies. For each movie, the site provides a synopsis as well as an aggregated rating from 0.0 to 5.0. . A data journalism piece (Hickey, 2015) investigated Fandango&#39;s rating system. By comparing the displayed ratings to those in the website&#39;s code, it found that almost half of the displayed ratings were rounded up inappropriately. Thus, most movies had a rating of at least 3 stars. Furthermore, Fandango&#39;s ratings were generally higher than those of other movie rating websites. This implied that Fandango may have altered its ratings in order to encourage people to purchase its tickets. . The present project aimed to determine whether the distribution of ratings has changed from the time of Hickey&#39;s analysis. Thus, the data used by Hickey was compared to more recent data from 2016. Furthermore, basic statistical concepts and hypothesis testing were applied in this project. The Mann-Whitney U rank test for independent samples showed that the distribution of 2015 ratings was significantly higher than that of 2016 ratings (p &lt; 0.001). . . Note: I wrote this notebook by following a guided project on the Dataquest platform, specifically the Guided Project: Investigating Fandango Movie Reviews. The general project flow and research questions came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. . Preparations . Below are the imports used for this project. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu . Population and Samples . Given the project goal, there were two populations of interest: . All movies released in 2015 with ratings on Fandango. | All movies released in 2016 with ratings on Fandango. | . However, the two datasets available included only samples of this population. These datasets were taken from Dataquest. . Dataset A was fandango_score_comparison.csv. It included movies released in 2014-2015 that had at least 30 reviews as of mid-2015. These amounted to 146 movies. The data dictionary, which explains the meanings of the data columns, can be found here. . Dataset B was movie_ratings_16_17.csv. It included 214 of the most popular movies released in 2016-2017. The ratings provided are from 2017. The data dictionary is here. . Given the descriptions of the two samples, it was clear that the sampling was not random. Certain criteria, such as the number of reviews or the popularity of the movie, were used to select movies. Therefore, the samples did not truly represent the populations of interest, which include all of the movies released in each year. . Therefore, the goal of the project was adjusted to account for the samples. We then sought to determine whether the distribution of Fandango ratings for popular movies in 2015 was similar to the distribution of Fandango ratings for popular movies in 2016. This new goal only considers &quot;popular&quot; movies, not all available movies. . However, &quot;popularity&quot; had to be given a precise definition. Since this could not be directly measured, the benchmark used in Hickey&#39;s analysis was used in this project. That is, all movies with at least 30 ratings were considered as &quot;popular&quot; movies. . Data Cleaning . Based on the adjusted goal of the project, the datasets were cleaned to get samples representative of the populations. . First, only movies released in 2015 were taken from Dataset A, and only movies released in 2016 were taken from Dataset B. . The next concern was that Dataset B did not provide the number of reviews, so the benchmark of having at least 30 reviews could not be used to identify objectively popular movies. However, it was possible to assume that all of the movies in Dataset B were popular. The person who scraped the data, Alex Olteanu, stated that he took the &quot;most voted and reviewed&quot; movies released in 2016 and 2017 (Olteanu, 2017). . The code below cleaned the data based on the above requirements, then printed the final sizes of the samples. . folder = &quot;./2021-11-18-Fandango-Ratings-Files&quot; # Obtain full data, which includes ratings from various sites df_a_all = pd.read_csv(folder + &quot;/fandango_score_comparison.csv&quot;) df_b_all = pd.read_csv(folder + &quot;/movie_ratings_16_17.csv&quot;) # Dataset A: Take only the data from Fandango, not other sites df_a = df_a_all[[ &quot;FILM&quot;, &quot;Fandango_Stars&quot;, &quot;Fandango_Ratingvalue&quot;, &quot;Fandango_votes&quot;, &quot;Fandango_Difference&quot;, ]].copy() # Create a column of release years based on the FILM column df_a.loc[:, &quot;year&quot;] = ( df_a .loc[:, &quot;FILM&quot;] .str.extract(r&quot; ((201[45]) )$&quot;) .astype(int, errors = &quot;ignore&quot;) ) # Take movies from 2015 df_a = df_a.loc[df_a[&quot;year&quot;] == 2015] # Dataset B: Take only data from Fandango, not other sites df_b = df_b_all[[ &quot;movie&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;fandango&quot;, ]].copy() # Take movies from 2016 df_b = df_b.loc[df_b[&quot;year&quot;] == 2016] print(&quot;Number of 2015 movies:&quot;, df_a.shape[0]) print(&quot;Number of 2016 movies:&quot;, df_b.shape[0]) . . Number of 2015 movies: 129 Number of 2016 movies: 191 . The sample sizes decreased because movies released in 2014 and 2017 were excluded. . The first 5 entries in Dataset A, from 2015, were shown below. . df_a.head() . . FILM Fandango_Stars Fandango_Ratingvalue Fandango_votes Fandango_Difference year . 0 Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) | 5.0 | 4.5 | 14846 | 0.5 | 2015 | . 1 Cinderella (2015) | 5.0 | 4.5 | 12640 | 0.5 | 2015 | . 2 Ant-Man (2015) | 5.0 | 4.5 | 12055 | 0.5 | 2015 | . 3 Do You Believe?

Fandango_Ratingvalue is the hidden rating found in the website&#39;s HTML, whereas Fandango_Stars is the value that was displayed on the webpages. . On the other hand, Dataset B only contained displayed ratings. The hidden ratings had been removed from the HTML before this dataset was collected. . df_b.head() . . movie year fandango . 0 10 Cloverfield Lane | 2016 | 3.5 | . 1 13 Hours | 2016 | 4.5 | . 2 A Cure for Wellness | 2016 | 3.0 | . 4 A Hologram for the King | 2016 | 3.0 | . 5 A Monster Calls | 2016 | 4.0 | . In both datasets, it may be observed that the displayed ratings were rounded to the nearest half-star from their original values. . Analysis . The goal was to determine whether the two samples have a similar distribution. Thus, a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot was used to visualize the distributions. KDE plots are similar to histograms, but these are smooth and continuous. The y-axis represents the approximated probability density at a particular value of x. (Waskom, 2021) . plt.style.use(&#39;fivethirtyeight&#39;) plt.figure(figsize = (10, 6)) sns.kdeplot( data = df_a, x = &quot;Fandango_Stars&quot;, label = &quot;Dataset A: 2015&quot;, ) sns.kdeplot( data = df_b, x = &quot;fandango&quot;, label = &quot;Dataset B: 2016&quot; ) plt.title(&quot;Fandango Displayed Rating Distribution in 2015 and 2016&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Fandango Rating&quot;) # Limit the x-axis to [0, 5] because this is the range of ratings plt.xlim(0, 5) # Show ticks in 0.5 intervals plt.xticks(np.arange(0.0, 5.5, 0.5)) plt.ylabel(&quot;Probability Density&quot;) plt.legend() plt.show() . . In the KDE plot above, the blue line represents the distribution of 2015 displayed ratings. On the other hand, the red line represents the distribution of 2016 displayed ratings. The hidden ratings from 2015 were excluded from this plot because these did not directly influence Fandango customers&#39; ticket-purchasing decisions, unlike the displayed ratings. . Both distributions were left-skewed. There were more high ratings than low ratings. However, the 2015 ratings noticeably had a higher mode, which was near 4.5. In general, the whole 2015 distribution seemed to be shifted to the right of the 2016 distribution. Therefore, it seemed that movies generally had higher Fandango ratings in 2015 than 2016. . In order to get more specific numbers, frequency tables were generated. . # Create a frequency table for Dataset B (2016) freq_b = df_b[&quot;fandango&quot;].value_counts(bins = 10).sort_index() freq_b.name = &quot;2016&quot; # Use the bins in the B table for the A table freq_a = {} for rating in df_a[&quot;Fandango_Stars&quot;]: for rng in freq_b.index: if rating in rng: freq_a.setdefault(rng, 0) freq_a[rng] += 1 freq_a = pd.Series(freq_a, name = &quot;2015&quot;) # Combine the tables into one freq_both = ( pd.DataFrame(freq_b) .merge( freq_a, how = &quot;left&quot;, left_index = True, right_index = True, ) .fillna(0) .loc[:, [&quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;]] ) # Display the table print(&quot;Number of ratings per interval of 0.25 stars&quot;) freq_both . . Number of ratings per interval of 0.25 stars . 2015 2016 . (2.4970000000000003, 2.75] 0.0 | 6 | . (2.75, 3.0] 11.0 | 14 | . (3.0, 3.25] 0.0 | 0 | . (3.25, 3.5] 23.0 | 46 | . (3.5, 3.75] 0.0 | 0 | . (3.75, 4.0] 37.0 | 77 | . (4.0, 4.25] 0.0 | 0 | . (4.25, 4.5] 49.0 | 47 | . (4.5, 4.75] 0.0 | 0 | . (4.75, 5.0] 9.0 | 1 | . The table shows that: . There were 11 more ratings above 4.25 in 2015 than in 2016. | There were 72 fewer ratings below 4.25 in 2015 than in 2016. | . This further supported the observation that Fandango&#39;s displayed ratings were generally higher in 2015 than in 2016. . In order to determine whether this difference was statistically significant, hypothesis testing for two independent samples was used. Since the two distributions both looked left-skewed rather than normal, it was appropriate to use the Mann-Whitney U rank test. According to NCSS (n.d.), this is a nonparametric test with the following assumptions: . The variable is continuous, or at least ordinal. Both datasets contained rounded mean ratings, so these followed an ordinal distribution with intervals of 0.5. | The two populations&#39; distributions are identical except for location. One may occupy a higher range than the other. This was fulfilled because all of the ratings came from Fandango. It was expected that the ratings would be consistently left-skewed, especially since there was only a one-year gap between our two populations. | The two samples are independent. This was true because there was no movie that existed in both datasets. Dataset A only contained movies released in 2015, and Dataset B only contained movies released in 2016. | The samples are simple random samples. It was not certain that the people who collected the data chose totally randomly from a list of popular movies. However, since this is the best data available, it had to be used. | . Let the distribution of Dataset A be F(u), and that of Dataset B be G(u). The alternative hypothesis was that F(u) &gt; G(u). The test was performed below using the Scipy package. . U1, p = mannwhitneyu( df_a[&quot;Fandango_Stars&quot;], df_b[&quot;fandango&quot;], # Alternative hypothesis alternative = &quot;greater&quot;, # Adjust for ties method = &quot;asymptotic&quot;, ) print(f&quot;U1 statistic: {U1}&quot;) print(f&quot;p-value: {p}&quot;) . . U1 statistic: 14871.5 p-value: 0.000516222939793581 . The $U$ statistic is the &quot;the total number of times an observation in one group is preceded by an observation in the other group in the ordered configuration of combined samples (Gibbons, 1985)[.]&quot; (NCSS, n.d.) . In this case, $U_1$ was the $U$ statistic of Dataset A with respect to Dataset B. Therefore, for around 14871.5 times, an observation in A was preceded by an observation in B. This was rather high, considering that each sample only had a few hundred observations. . More importantly, the p-value was approximately 0.0005. Therefore, the difference between the two populations was significant at $ alpha = 0.001$. The distribution of ratings in 2015 was significantly greater than that in 2016. . Conclusion . A KDE plot, frequency table, and Mann-Whitney U rank test were used to investigate the Fandango ratings of popular movies. Based on the results, the alternative hypothesis is accepted. The ratings displayed in 2015 were significantly higher than those in 2016 (p &lt; 0.001). . The implication is that Fandango may have investigated the issues raised in Hickey&#39;s analysis and fixed their displayed ratings. They may have stopped the numbers from being rounded up excessively, so the 2016 ratings ended up being lower than the 2015 ratings. . Bibliography . Information Sources .

            "content": "Unsplash | Clay Banks Overview . The Chinook database by Luis Rocha and Brice Lambson is a sample database about a hypothetical digital media store called Chinook. This store sells individual music tracks online, similar to iTunes. The database contains tables covering various aspects of the company, such as the employees, customers, invoices, tracks, albums, and artists. . The schema below, which was designed by Dataquest, lists the columns under each table. Columns connected by lines contain matching information. . Dataquest Guided Project: Answering Business Questions Using SQL The matching columns allow us to perform joins on these tables. Thus, we are able to answer more complicated questions about the data. . In our hypothetical scenario, the Chinook company has requested us to answer the following business questions: . What are the best-selling music genres with regards to USA customers? Based on this, which new albums should be purchased for the Chinook store? | Which of Chinook&#39;s sales support agents has the highest total sales from their assigned customers? Can the exemplary performance of these employees be explained by any information in the database? | What are the statistics on the customers and sales for each country where Chinook offers its service? | How many purchases are full albums, and how many are selected sets of tracks? Based on this, what strategy should Chinook adopt when buying new tracks from record companies? | . SQL will be used to answer all of these questions. Matplotlib and Altair will also be used to produce helpful visualizations. . .

Each column has a different name and data type. | Views do not contain data. Instead, these are pre-written SQL queries which show a transformation of existing data.

Each row in this table contains data on a different customer of Chinook. Each customer has a unique customer ID and an assigned support representative from Chinook. The support rep&#39;s employee ID is stored in the support_rep_id column. The other columns contain information on the customer&#39;s name, occupation, location, and contact details. . Note: All names and personal details in the Chinook database are fictitious and randomly generated. Public use of this database is not a breach of data privacy. . Best-Selling Music Genres in the USA . In our first scenario, Chinook has signed a deal with a new record company, so its tracks can now be put up for sale on the Chinook store. The record company has 4 albums so far; below are the artist names and their genres. . Regal (Hip-Hop) | Red Tone (Punk) | Meteor and the Girls (Pop) | Slim Jim Bites (Blues) | . However, Chinook would like to spread its releases over time, so it will only add 3 albums to the store. Thus, we have to determine the best-selling genres on the store. Furthermore, since the record company would like to target a USA audience, we can narrow our analysis to Chinook&#39;s USA customers. . First, we create a view called usa_track_purchases. This will show the genre, track name, unit price, and quantity bought for each of the invoice lines of USA customers. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS usa_track_purchases; CREATE VIEW usa_track_purchases AS SELECT il.invoice_line_id AS invoice_line_id, g.name AS genre, t.name AS track_name, il.unit_price AS unit_price, il.quantity AS quantity FROM customer AS c INNER JOIN invoice AS iv ON iv.customer_id = c.customer_id INNER JOIN invoice_line AS il ON il.invoice_id = iv.invoice_id INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.track_id = il.track_id INNER JOIN genre AS g ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id WHERE c.country = &quot;USA&quot; ; SELECT * FROM usa_track_purchases LIMIT 7 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

By querying the view above, we will create another view, usa_genre_sales. This will contain the following specific information about each genre: . Number of tracks sold | Percentage of tracks sold | Total sales in US dollars | . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS usa_genre_sales; CREATE VIEW usa_genre_sales AS SELECT genre, SUM(quantity) AS number_sold, --Get the quantity per genre and divide it by the total quantity of USA purchases.

We can make a bar graph from this result in order to communicate findings better. . ( alt.Chart(usa_genre_df) .mark_bar() .encode( x = alt.X(&quot;genre:N&quot;, title = &quot;Music Genre&quot;, sort = &quot;-y&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;percentage_sold:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Percentage of All Purchases in the USA&quot;), color = alt.Color(&quot;total_sales:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Total Sales (USD)&quot;), tooltip = usa_genre_df.columns.tolist(), ) .properties( title = &quot;Popularity of Music Genres with Chinook&#39;s USA Customers&quot;, height = 300, width = 600, ) .configure_axis( labelAngle = 30, ) .interactive() ) . . One can hover over each bar in the chart above for a tooltip with more specific information. . Results show that Rock is the best-selling music genre as it makes up 53% of total purchases in the USA. Rock is followed by the Alternative &amp; Punk and Metal genres, which each make up over 10% of purchases. . On a side note, the total_sales column&#39;s values are very close to that of the number_sold column. This can be explained by the fact that track prices range from USD 0.99 to USD 1.99. . %%sql SELECT MIN(unit_price) AS min_price, MAX(unit_price) AS max_price FROM track ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done. . min_price max_price . 0.99 | 1.99 | . Since there is little variation among track prices, the genre with the most units sold is usually also the genre with the highest sales. . Going back to the scenario at hand, we need to compare the statistics on the Hip-Hop, Punk, Pop, and Blues genres. We will run a query for this below. . %%sql SELECT * FROM usa_genre_sales WHERE genre IN (&quot;Hip Hop/Rap&quot;, &quot;Alternative &amp; Punk&quot;, &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Blues&quot;) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done. . genre number_sold percentage_sold total_sales .

The result above shows that Alternative &amp; Punk, Blues, and Pop are the three best-selling genres out of the four. Notably, Alternative &amp; Punk makes up 12.37% of all purchases in the USA. . Therefore, we would recommend the Chinook administration to add the albums of Red Tone (Punk), Slim Jim Bites (Blues), and Meteor and the Girls (Pop) to the digital store. The album of Regal (Hip-Hop) has lower priority and can be added at a later date. . Sales Support Agent Performance . Next, Chinook is requesting us to evaluate the performance of its sales support agents. Each customer is assigned to an agent after their first purchase. Since there are only 3 agents, each agent provides support to many customers. Details about the agents are shown in the query below. . %%sql SELECT * FROM employee WHERE title = &quot;Sales Support Agent&quot; ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done. . employee_id last_name first_name title reports_to birthdate hire_date address city state country postal_code phone fax email . 3 | Peacock | Jane | Sales Support Agent | 2 | 1973-08-29 00:00:00 | 2017-04-01 00:00:00 | 1111 6 Ave SW | Calgary | AB | Canada | T2P 5M5 | +1 (403) 262-3443 | +1 (403) 262-6712 | jane@chinookcorp.com | . 4 | Park | Margaret | Sales Support Agent | 2 | 1947-09-19 00:00:00 | 2017-05-03 00:00:00 | 683 10 Street SW | Calgary | AB | Canada | T2P 5G3 | +1 (403) 263-4423 | +1 (403) 263-4289 | margaret@chinookcorp.com | . 5 | Johnson | Steve | Sales Support Agent | 2 | 1965-03-03 00:00:00 | 2017-10-17 00:00:00 | 7727B 41 Ave | Calgary | AB | Canada | T3B 1Y7 | 1 (780) 836-9987 | 1 (780) 836-9543 | steve@chinookcorp.com | . Since we have data on each customer&#39;s purchases, we can calculate the total purchases associated with each support agent. We can then use this to compare the performance of the agents. . First, we create a view called agent_customer by joining the employee table with the customer table based on the support representative ID. We will include some extra details about each agent, such as their birthdate and hire date. We won&#39;t include their location since we know that they are all in Calgary, AB, Canada. As for the customers, we will include their customer ID, name, and total purchases as the sum of their invoices. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS agent_customer; CREATE VIEW agent_customer AS SELECT e.employee_id AS agent_id, e.first_name || &quot; &quot; || e.last_name AS agent_name, e.birthdate AS agent_bd, e.hire_date AS agent_hire_date, c.customer_id AS customer_id, c.first_name || &quot; &quot; || c.last_name AS customer_name, SUM(iv.total) AS customer_total_purchases FROM employee AS e LEFT JOIN customer AS c ON c.support_rep_id = e.employee_id LEFT JOIN invoice AS iv ON iv.customer_id = c.customer_id WHERE e.title = &quot;Sales Support Agent&quot; GROUP BY c.customer_id ORDER BY agent_id, customer_id ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

Next, we will query this view in order to determine the following information about each agent: . number of customers | total sales from the agent&#39;s customers | percentage of all agents&#39; sales | average sales per customer | . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS agent_stats; CREATE VIEW agent_stats AS SELECT agent_id, agent_name, agent_bd, agent_hire_date, COUNT(customer_id) AS number_customers, ROUND( SUM(customer_total_purchases), 2 ) AS sales_number, ROUND( SUM(customer_total_purchases) / (SELECT SUM(customer_total_purchases) FROM agent_customer) * 100, 2 )AS sales_percentage, ROUND( AVG(customer_total_purchases), 2 ) AS average_per_customer FROM agent_customer GROUP BY agent_id ; SELECT * FROM agent_stats ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

At first glance, Jane Peacock seems like the best-performing agent since Chinook got the highest total sales from her customers (USD 1731.51). This idea is cast into doubt when it is mentioned that she had the highest number of customers (21). . Also, the differences among the average sales per customer is quite small. Each of Jane&#39;s customers spends 3 more dollars on Chinook than each of Margaret&#39;s. Each of Margaret&#39;s customers spends 2 more dollars on Chinook than each of Steve Johnson&#39;s. . The average sales per customer may also be influenced by outliers, as shown by the boxplot below. . ( alt.Chart(agent_customer_df) .mark_boxplot() .encode( y = alt.Y(&quot;customer_total_purchases:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Customer Total Purchases&quot;), x = alt.X(&quot;agent_name:N&quot;, title = &quot;Agent Name&quot;), ) .properties( title = &quot;Distribution of Customer Purchases by Sales Support Agent&quot;, height = 300, width = 500, ) .interactive() ) . . If we hover over each of the boxes above, we can get more information such as minimum, 1st quartile, median, etc. The median is less influenced by outliers, so we can look at that. The median values are 79.20 (Jane), 77.72 (Margaret), and 75.74 (Steve). These values are still very close to each other. . Therefore, we cannot conclusively state that any agent performs better than the others. . Sales Data by Country . Next, Chinook is requesting us to analyze sales in each country where it offers its service. Specifically, they would like to know the: . total number of customers | total value of sales | average sales per customer | average order value Every order is a batch purchase of multiple tracks. | . | . Furthermore, since there are some countries in the database with only one customer, we shall group these customers together under a category called &quot;Other&quot;, which must appear at the very bottom of our final result. . First, we will create a view, country_invoices, which shows all invoices and the country of the customer. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS country_invoices; CREATE VIEW country_invoices AS SELECT c.country AS country, c.customer_id AS customer_id, c.first_name || &quot; &quot; || c.last_name AS customer_name, iv.invoice_id AS invoice_id, iv.total AS order_value FROM customer AS c LEFT JOIN invoice AS iv ON iv.customer_id = c.customer_id ; SELECT * FROM country_invoices LIMIT 5 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

Then, we will create a view, country_customers, which shows the total purchases per customer. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS country_customers; CREATE VIEW country_customers AS SELECT country, customer_id, customer_name, SUM(order_value) AS customer_total_purchase FROM country_invoices GROUP BY customer_id ; SELECT * FROM country_customers LIMIT 5 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

We will then create a view called country_labels. It will show the number of customers per country. Countries with only 1 customer will be given a label of &quot;Other&quot;. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS country_labels; CREATE VIEW country_labels AS SELECT country, COUNT(customer_id) AS number_customers, CASE WHEN COUNT(customer_id) &gt; 1 THEN country ELSE &quot;Other&quot; END AS country_label, CASE WHEN COUNT(customer_id) &gt; 1 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS is_other FROM country_customers GROUP BY country ; SELECT * FROM country_labels LIMIT 10 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

We will also create a view called country_avg_order which simply shows the average order value per country. This will be done by querying the country_invoices view. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS country_avg_order; CREATE VIEW country_avg_order AS SELECT cl.country_label, AVG(civ.order_value) AS avg_order_value FROM country_invoices AS civ INNER JOIN country_labels AS cl ON cl.country = civ.country GROUP BY cl.country_label ; SELECT * FROM country_avg_order ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

Finally, we will create a view called country_stats that shows all of the 4 statistics that were requested by the Chinook management. The &quot;Other&quot; entry will be forced to the bottom of the query result using the is_other column we created in the country_labels view. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS country_stats; CREATE VIEW country_stats AS SELECT l.country_label, COUNT(c.customer_id) AS number_customers, ROUND(SUM(c.customer_total_purchase), 2) AS total_sales, ROUND(AVG(c.customer_total_purchase), 2) AS avg_sales_customer, ROUND(a.avg_order_value, 2) AS avg_order_value FROM country_customers AS c INNER JOIN country_labels AS l ON l.country = c.country INNER JOIN country_avg_order AS a ON a.country_label = l.country_label GROUP BY l.country_label ORDER BY l.is_other ASC, total_sales DESC ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

We can make a scatter plot with the data above in order to make results more clear. . # Exclude the &quot;Other&quot; entry. main_df = country_stats_df.loc[country_stats_df[&quot;country_label&quot;] != &quot;Other&quot;] # Base layer. base = ( alt.Chart(main_df) .mark_point(size = 300) # Set default size of points to 300 pixels. .encode( x = alt.X(&quot;number_customers:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Number of Customers&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;total_sales:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Total Sales (USD)&quot;), ) ) # Scatter plot layer. points = base.encode( color = alt.Color(&quot;avg_sales_customer:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Average Sales per Customer (USD)&quot;), tooltip = country_stats_df.columns.tolist(), ) # Text layer. text = ( base .mark_text( # Move text to the top left of each point. align = &quot;right&quot;, dy = -5, dx = -20, ) .encode( text = &quot;country_label:N&quot; ) ) # Combine layers. chart = ( (points + text) .properties( title = &quot;Chinook Sales by Country&quot;, height = 300, width = 700, ) .interactive() ) # Display chart. chart . . Looking at the top right of the chart, we can see that the USA has the highest number of Chinook customers (13), as well as the highest total sales (USD 1040.49). All of the other countries have only 2 to 8 customers. . On the other hand, the Czech Republic has the highest average sales per customer at USD 136.62; this is indicated by its dark color in the chart. This country also had the highest average order value at USD 9.11. This means that though the country has few customers, these people are avid buyers of music. . Chinook may benefit from marketing its service more aggressively in countries other than the USA where it has gained a good foothold, such as Canada, Brazil, and France. Chinook may also target the Czech Republic since the customers there seem to buy a lot of music on a per-person basis. . Comparing Purchase Types: Full Album vs Selected Sets . In our last scenario, we have been requested to compare the popularities of Chinook&#39;s two purchase types: . Full album The customer buys a full album. | Albums are pre-defined in Chinook&#39;s library. The customer may not add other tracks on top of an album. | . | Selected set of tracks The customer manually selects any number of individual tracks. | . | . In both cases, each track is bought at its unit price; there are no discounts. . Currently, Chinook&#39;s purchasing strategy is to buy full albums from record companies. However, Chinook doesn&#39;t know whether full album purchases are popular among its customers. If selected sets are more popular, then Chinook may switch to a new strategy in which it will only buy the most popular individual tracks from record companies. . Our analysis will help Chinook make the final decision. For each purchase type, we will show the number of invoices and percentage of all invoices with that type. The type with the higher number will be the more popular one. . First, we create a view, invoice_tracks, that shows all tracks under each invoice. The album associated with each track is also shown. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS invoice_tracks_bought; CREATE VIEW invoice_tracks_bought AS SELECT iv.invoice_id AS invoice_id, il.track_id AS track_id, t.name AS track_name, t.album_id AS album_id, a.title AS album_name FROM invoice AS iv INNER JOIN invoice_line AS il ON il.invoice_id = iv.invoice_id INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.track_id = il.track_id INNER JOIN album AS a ON a.album_id = t.album_id ORDER BY invoice_id, track_id, album_id ; SELECT * FROM invoice_tracks_bought LIMIT 7 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

Then, we create a view called invoice_album, which shows only the album associated with the first track of each invoice. This way, there is only one row per invoice. We will also include the total purchase amount of each invoice so that we can use it later. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS invoice_album; CREATE VIEW invoice_album AS SELECT itb.invoice_id AS invoice_id, MIN(itb.album_id) AS album_id, itb.album_name AS album_name, iv.total AS total_purchase FROM invoice_tracks_bought AS itb INNER JOIN invoice AS iv ON iv.invoice_id = itb.invoice_id GROUP BY itb.invoice_id ORDER BY itb.invoice_id ; SELECT * FROM invoice_album LIMIT 5 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

Then, we join invoice_album with the track table in order to list all of the tracks under the album associated with each invoice. The result will be a view called invoice_full_album_tracks. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS invoice_full_album_tracks; CREATE VIEW invoice_full_album_tracks AS SELECT ia.*, t.track_id AS track_id, t.name AS track_name FROM invoice_album AS ia INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.album_id = ia.album_id ORDER BY invoice_id, album_id, track_id ; SELECT * FROM invoice_full_album_tracks LIMIT 5 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

The invoice_full_album_tracks view looks very similar to the invoice_tracks_bought view at first glance. However, there is a difference: . invoice_tracks_bought It contains the tracks bought in each invoice. | Each set of tracks may or may not be a full album. | . | invoice_full_album_tracks It contains all of the tracks under one album associated with an invoice. | Some of these tracks may not have been bought by the customer. | . | . Next, we will create a new view called invoice_purchase_type which indicates whether each invoice is a &quot;Full Album&quot; or &quot;Selected Set&quot; purchase. . In order to determine this, we will have a CASE statement which can be explained as follows: . WHEN clause: If the set of tracks bought and the full album are exactly the same, mark the purchase type as &quot;Full Album&quot;. | ELSE clause: Otherwise, mark the purchase type as &quot;Selected Set&quot;. | . Inside the WHEN clause, we have a rather complicated-looking set of operations. Let&#39;s look at one part: . ( SELECT itb.track_id FROM invoice_tracks_bought AS itb WHERE itb.invoice_id = ia.invoice_id EXCEPT SELECT ifa.track_id FROM invoice_full_album_tracks AS ifa WHERE ifa.invoice_id = ia.invoice_id ) IS NULL . In order to make the explanation more simple, we can call the subqueries above &quot;set 1&quot; and &quot;set 2&quot;. . ( {set 1} EXCEPT {set 2} ) IS NULL . Set 1 represents all tracks bought in one invoice. | Set 2 represents the full set of tracks in an album associated with the invoice. | Via EXCEPT and IS NULL, we check whether Set 1 is a subset of Set 2. If it is, the result is True. | Otherwise, False. | . | . We then repeat the same process but in reverse, to check if Set 2 is a subset of Set 1. We thus end up with two boolean values, and we use the AND operator on these. . ( {set 1} EXCEPT {set 2} ) IS NULL AND ( {set 2} EXCEPT {set 1} ) IS NULL . The purpose of AND is to determine the following. . If both conditions are True: The two sets of tracks match exactly. | The invoice is a &quot;Full Album&quot; purchase. | . | If any condition is False: The two sets of tracks do not match exactly. | The invoice is a &quot;Selected Set&quot; purchase. | . | . The full query is shown below. . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS invoice_purchase_type; CREATE VIEW invoice_purchase_type AS SELECT ia.invoice_id, CASE WHEN ( ( SELECT itb.track_id FROM invoice_tracks_bought AS itb WHERE itb.invoice_id = ia.invoice_id EXCEPT SELECT ifa.track_id FROM invoice_full_album_tracks AS ifa WHERE ifa.invoice_id = ia.invoice_id ) IS NULL AND ( SELECT ifa.track_id FROM invoice_full_album_tracks AS ifa WHERE ifa.invoice_id = ia.invoice_id EXCEPT SELECT itb.track_id FROM invoice_tracks_bought AS itb WHERE itb.invoice_id = ia.invoice_id ) IS NULL ) THEN &quot;Full Album&quot; ELSE &quot;Selected Set&quot; END AS purchase_type, ia.total_purchase AS total_purchase FROM invoice_album AS ia ; SELECT * FROM invoice_purchase_type LIMIT 10 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

With the view above, we can finally answer the question being asked. A view called purchase_type_proportion will be created which shows the following information per purchase type: . number of invoices | percentage of invoices | average sales per invoice | sales in USD | percentage of total sales | . %%sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS purchase_type_proportion; CREATE VIEW purchase_type_proportion AS SELECT purchase_type, COUNT(purchase_type) AS type_count, ROUND( CAST(COUNT(purchase_type) AS Float) / CAST( (SELECT COUNT(purchase_type) FROM invoice_purchase_type) AS Float ) * 100, 2 ) AS type_percentage, ROUND( AVG(total_purchase), 2 ) AS avg_sales_per_invoice, ROUND( SUM(total_purchase), 2 ) AS sales_number, ROUND( SUM(total_purchase) / (SELECT SUM(total_purchase) FROM invoice_purchase_type) * 100, 2 ) AS sales_percentage FROM invoice_purchase_type GROUP BY purchase_type ORDER BY type_count DESC ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-31-Intermediate-SQL-Files/chinook.db Done.

The type_percentage column shows that the majority (81%) of all Chinook invoices are Selected Sets. Full Album purchases only make up 19% of all invoices. . This is shown in the pie chart below. . colors = sns.color_palette(&#39;pastel&#39;)[:2] plt.pie( x = purchase_type_df[&quot;type_percentage&quot;], labels = purchase_type_df[&quot;purchase_type&quot;], colors = colors, autopct = &quot;%0.2f%%&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Proportion of Chinook Store Invoices by Purchase Type&quot;) plt.show() . . However, the average sales per Full Album purchase is almost twice that of a Selected Set purchase. This is shown in the bar chart below. . # Base layer with bar chart base = ( alt.Chart(purchase_type_df) .mark_bar() .encode( x = alt.X(&quot;purchase_type:N&quot;, title = &quot;Purchase Type&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;avg_sales_per_invoice:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Average Sales per Invoice (USD)&quot;), tooltip = purchase_type_df.columns.tolist(), ) ) # Text layer text = ( base .mark_text( align = &quot;center&quot;, dy = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;, ) .encode( text = &quot;avg_sales_per_invoice:Q&quot;, ) ) # Combine layers into one chart chart = ( (base + text) .properties( title = &quot;Average Sales per Invoice by Purchase Type&quot;, height = 300, width = 200, ) .configure_axis(labelAngle = 30) .interactive() ) # Display chart. chart . . Full Albums cost more than Selected Sets because the former tend to have more tracks. Thus, even if Full Albums only represent 19% of all invoices, these also represent 31% of all dollar sales. This is shown in the pie chart below. . plt.pie( x = purchase_type_df[&quot;sales_percentage&quot;], labels = purchase_type_df[&quot;purchase_type&quot;], colors = colors, autopct = &quot;%0.2f%%&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Proportion of Chinook Store Sales by Purchase Type&quot;) plt.show() . . Overall, though, Selected Sets still represent the majority of Chinook&#39;s invoices (81%) and sales (69%). Therefore, we recommend that Chinook shift to a new purchasing strategy in which it only buys the most popular tracks from record companies. Chinook should not buy full albums since it is less likely for customers to purchase these. . Conclusion . In this project, we used intermediate SQL techniques to answer business questions for a hypothetical digital media store called Chinook. We solved a total of 4 scenarios by creating views and gradually working towards a final query. We also ended each scenario with a chart that communicates our findings more engagingly. . Below is a summary of all of the questions and our findings. . . What are the best-selling music genres with regards to USA customers? Based on this, which new albums should be purchased for the Chinook store? . Rock is the best-selling music genre as it makes up 53% of total purchases in the USA. Rock is followed by the Alternative &amp; Punk genre and Metal genre, which each make up over 10% of purchases. . Among the 4 new albums which may be added to the digital store, we recommend the following 3 artists&#39; albums: Red Tone (Punk), Slim Jim Bites (Blues), and Meteor and the Girls (Pop). . . Which of Chinook&#39;s sales support agents has the highest total sales from their assigned customers? Can the exemplary performance of these employees be explained by any information in the database? . Sales support agent Jane Peacock has the highest total sales (37% of all sales) from her customers. She also has the highest average sales per customer (USD 82). . However, her statistics are only slightly higher than that of her colleagues. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say that she is the best-performing agent. . . What are the statistics on the customers and sales for each country where Chinook offers its service? . The USA has the highest number of Chinook customers (13), as well as the highest total sales (USD 1040.49). All of the other countries have only 2 to 8 customers. . We recommend marketing Chinook more aggressively in Canada, Brazil, and France since these countries have the highest number of customers after the USA. We also recommend expanding into the Czech Republic since it has a high average value of sales per customer. . . How many purchases are full albums, and how many are manually selected sets of tracks? Based on this, what strategy should Chinook adopt when buying new tracks from record companies? . Selected Sets account for 81% of all invoices and 69% of total sales. Therefore, these are more popular than Full Albums. . Thus, we recommend that Chinook buy only the most popular tracks from record companies. This would be more cost-effective than buying full albums. . . That concludes this project. Thanks for reading! .",

            "title": "Using SQL to Query and Analyze a CIA Factbook Database",
            "content": "Unsplash | NASA Overview . The CIA World Factbook website is a collection of basic information on hundreds of countries and geopolitical entities. Each country is discussed with regards to a wide range of aspects, such as politics, security, socio-economics, and environment. . For this project, we have downloaded the factbook.db database file, which contains CIA World Factbook data compiled by Dataquest. The goal of the project is to use sqlite3 in Jupyter Notebook to query this database and perform basic exploratory data analysis. Specifically, SQL is used to produce summary statistics and data transformations, Pandas is used to perform further transformations, and Altair is used to create interactive charts. . . Note: I wrote this notebook by following a guided project on the Dataquest platform, specifically, the Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL Guided Project. The general project flow and research questions came from Dataquest. However, the text and code in this notebook are written by me unless stated otherwise. . Preparations . Install necessary packages. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import altair as alt . Connect Jupyter Notebook to the database file using the SQLite flavor of SQL. . %load_ext sql %sql sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db . &#39;Connected: @2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db&#39; . Exploratory Data Analysis . Database Tables . First, we inspect the tables in the database. SQL is used in a code cell via the %%sql magic. . %%sql SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = &quot;table&quot;; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . type name tbl_name rootpage sql . table | sqlite_sequence | sqlite_sequence | 3 | CREATE TABLE sqlite_sequence(name,seq) | . table | facts | facts | 47 | CREATE TABLE &quot;facts&quot; (&quot;id&quot; INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, &quot;code&quot; varchar(255) NOT NULL, &quot;name&quot; varchar(255) NOT NULL, &quot;area&quot; integer, &quot;area_land&quot; integer, &quot;area_water&quot; integer, &quot;population&quot; integer, &quot;population_growth&quot; float, &quot;birth_rate&quot; float, &quot;death_rate&quot; float, &quot;migration_rate&quot; float) | . There are two tables in the database: sqlite_sequence and facts. The latter contains the data that we will analyze. The sql column above lists the columns in the facts table and their data types. The column names include &quot;area&quot;, &quot;population&quot;, &quot;population_growth&quot;, etc. which are the kind of information that we would expect to know about a country. . The facts Table . Let us inspect the first 5 rows of the facts table. . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts LIMIT 5 --#Limit the result to the first 5 rows. ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 1 | af | Afghanistan | 652230 | 652230 | 0 | 32564342 | 2.32 | 38.57 | 13.89 | 1.51 | . 2 | al | Albania | 28748 | 27398 | 1350 | 3029278 | 0.3 | 12.92 | 6.58 | 3.3 | . 3 | ag | Algeria | 2381741 | 2381741 | 0 | 39542166 | 1.84 | 23.67 | 4.31 | 0.92 | . 4 | an | Andorra | 468 | 468 | 0 | 85580 | 0.12 | 8.13 | 6.96 | 0.0 | . 5 | ao | Angola | 1246700 | 1246700 | 0 | 19625353 | 2.78 | 38.78 | 11.49 | 0.46 | . Most of the column names are self-explanatory. The following are some additional information about the data according to Dataquest. . The areas are given in square kilometers ($ text{km}^2$) | population_growth is given as the percentage of increase of the total population per year. | birth_rate and death_rate are given as the number of people who are born/pass away per year per 1000 people. | . Summary Statistics on Population Size and Growth . Below, we calculate some basic summary statistics about the countries&#39; populations and population growths. We want to see which countries have the highest and lowest value of each variable. . %%sql SELECT MIN(population), MAX(population), MIN(population_growth), MAX(population_growth) FROM facts ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . MIN(population) MAX(population) MIN(population_growth) MAX(population_growth) . 0 | 7256490011 | 0.0 | 4.02 | . Interestingly, the minimum population size among all of the countries in the table is 0, meaning no people at all. This is surprising since one would expect a country to have many people. This may indicate an error in the data, so let&#39;s check which countries have 0 people. . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population == 0 ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 250 | ay | Antarctica | None | 280000 | None | 0 | None | None | None | None | . It turns out that it is not a country, but rather the continent of Antarctica, which is at the South Pole. It is too cold there for people to live comfortably, so of course its population size would be 0. . The maximum population size, on the other hand, is over 7 billion, which seems too large. Let&#39;s check which country this is. . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population == ( SELECT MAX(population) --# Use a subquery to get the exact value of the maximum population size. FROM facts ) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 261 | xx | World | None | None | None | 7256490011 | 1.08 | 18.6 | 7.8 | None | . It turns out that 7 billion refers to the total population in the entire world, not one country, so there is no error in the data. The data seems to have been collected in the mid-2010s, since the world population reached 7.2 billion in 2013. . Revised Summary Statistics . We&#39;ve come to the realization that this database doesn&#39;t just include entries on individual countries but also on entire continents and the entire world. Therefore, if we want to find useful information, we should exclude the entries for Antarctica and the World. We can do this using SQL&#39;s NOT IN operator. . Let&#39;s run our initial query again with this in mind. . %%sql SELECT MIN(population), MAX(population), MIN(population_growth), MAX(population_growth) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) --# Exclude World and Antarctica from the entries being used in computation. ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . MIN(population) MAX(population) MIN(population_growth) MAX(population_growth) . 48 | 1367485388 | 0.0 | 4.02 | . The population growth statistics are the same as before, but now, the population size statistics are different. . Interestingly, the minimum population size is still very small—only 48 people. Which country is this? . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population == ( SELECT MIN(population) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 238 | pc | Pitcairn Islands | 47 | 47 | 0 | 48 | 0.0 | None | None | None | . The country with a population of 48 is the Pitcairn Islands, which, according to the World Factbook, is a colony of the UK. The islands are small (the query result above shows only 47 square kilometers of land), so there are few people. . On the other hand, the maximum population size was over 1.3 billion. Let&#39;s check which country this is. . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population == ( SELECT MAX(population) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 37 | ch | China | 9596960 | 9326410 | 270550 | 1367485388 | 0.45 | 12.49 | 7.53 | 0.44 | . Of course, the country with the largest population would be China. I expected this before I ran the query; China is well-known for the one-child policy that it enacted from 1980 to 2015 in order to curb the growth of its huge population. . Now, let&#39;s investigate the minimum population growth, which was 0%. This means that the population wasn&#39;t increasing at all at that time. . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population_growth == 0 AND name NOT IN (&quot;Antarctica&quot;, &quot;World&quot;) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 190 | vt | Holy See (Vatican City) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 842 | 0.0 | None | None | None | . 200 | ck | Cocos (Keeling) Islands | 14 | 14 | 0 | 596 | 0.0 | None | None | None | . 207 | gl | Greenland | 2166086 | 2166086 | None | 57733 | 0.0 | 14.48 | 8.49 | 5.98 | . 238 | pc | Pitcairn Islands | 47 | 47 | 0 | 48 | 0.0 | None | None | None | . Four countries have shown up in the results. One of these is the Pitcairn Islands which were mentioned earlier. This makes sense as they have few people to begin with, and the Factbook states that it is rare for outsiders to migrate there. . Interestingly, Vatican City is among the countries without population growth, but this makes sense too. It is a small independent state within Italy that serves as the authority of Roman Catholicism. . Finally, let&#39;s check the country with the highest population growth rate. . %%sql SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population_growth == ( SELECT MAX(population_growth) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . id code name area area_land area_water population population_growth birth_rate death_rate migration_rate . 162 | od | South Sudan | 644329 | None | None | 12042910 | 4.02 | 36.91 | 8.18 | 11.47 | . The country with the highest population growth rate is South Sudan. Its population was increasing by 4.02% annually at the time that the data was collected. According to Hicks (2017), there was widespread famine in South Sudan, and its high population growth rendered the country&#39;s level of food production insufficient. . Population Raw Increase . Out of curiosity, we can investigate which countries may have the highest population raw increase. This means the increase in terms of the number of people as opposed to the percentage of the population. . We can calculate this in an SQL query by multiplying population size by population growth rate. However, the query result needs to be stored as a DataFrame so that it can be used in a chart. . First, we can store the result of an SQL query as a ResultSet object by using the &lt;&lt; operator, according to the ipython-sql README. . %%sql result &lt;&lt; SELECT name, population, population_growth, (population * population_growth / 100.0) AS &quot;population_raw_increase&quot; FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ORDER BY population_raw_increase DESC ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. Returning data to local variable result . Then, the ResultSet can be converted into a DataFrame via its .DataFrame() method. . pop_increase = result.DataFrame() print(pop_increase.shape) pop_increase.head(10) . (259, 4) . name population population_growth population_raw_increase . 0 India | 1.251696e+09 | 1.22 | 1.527069e+07 | . 1 China | 1.367485e+09 | 0.45 | 6.153684e+06 | . 2 Nigeria | 1.815621e+08 | 2.45 | 4.448270e+06 | . 3 Pakistan | 1.990858e+08 | 1.46 | 2.906653e+06 | . 4 Ethiopia | 9.946582e+07 | 2.89 | 2.874562e+06 | . 5 Bangladesh | 1.689577e+08 | 1.60 | 2.703324e+06 | . 6 United States | 3.213689e+08 | 0.78 | 2.506677e+06 | . 7 Indonesia | 2.559937e+08 | 0.92 | 2.355142e+06 | . 8 Congo, Democratic Republic of the | 7.937514e+07 | 2.45 | 1.944691e+06 | . 9 Philippines | 1.009984e+08 | 1.61 | 1.626074e+06 | . The DataFrame above shows the top 10 countries in terms of population raw increase, which is written in scientific notation. Notably, while most of the values have an exponent of 6, India&#39;s has an exponent of 7. This means that its population raw increase is a whole order of magnitude higher than that of the other countries. . We can communicate this result better by graphing population growth against population size, with population raw increase as a continuous grouping variable. . ( alt.Chart(pop_increase) .mark_point() .encode( x = alt.X(&quot;population:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Population Size&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;population_growth:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Population Growth Rate (% of Population)&quot;), color = alt.Color(&quot;population_raw_increase:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Population Raw Increase&quot;), tooltip = [ &quot;name&quot;, &quot;population&quot;, &quot;population_growth&quot;, &quot;population_raw_increase&quot;, ] ) .properties(title = &quot;Population Growth Rate against Population Size&quot;) .interactive() ) . . One can click, drag, and scroll on the chart above in order to explore its data points. Hover over a point in order to view extra information like the country&#39;s name. . In the case of the chart above, the population raw increase variable ranges from 0 people to 15 million people; this range is expressed with a color gradient. Looking at the data points, we can see that most of them are pale blue, indicating a low increase. India&#39;s point has the darkest blue color. . Hovering over India&#39;s point, we can see its tooltip, which states that the population growth rate of India is 1.22%. This is not the highest global population growth rate; we saw earlier that this is around 4%. However, India&#39;s extremely large population size (over 1 billion) leads it to have the highest raw population increase. . Population Density . Next, in this section, we will find the average population size and average land area among all countries. . %%sql SELECT AVG(population), AVG(area_land) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . AVG(population) AVG(area_land) . 32377011.0125 | 523693.2 | . The average population size is over 32 million people, and the average land area is over 500 thousand square kilometers. . We can now investigate which countries have above-average population size and below-average land area. . %%sql SELECT name, population, population_growth, area_land FROM facts WHERE population &gt; ( SELECT AVG(population) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ) AND area_land &lt; ( SELECT AVG(area_land) FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ) AND name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ORDER BY population_growth DESC ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. . name population population_growth area_land . Uganda | 37101745 | 3.24 | 197100 | . Iraq | 37056169 | 2.93 | 437367 | . Philippines | 100998376 | 1.61 | 298170 | . Bangladesh | 168957745 | 1.6 | 130170 | . Morocco | 33322699 | 1.0 | 446300 | . Vietnam | 94348835 | 0.97 | 310070 | . Spain | 48146134 | 0.89 | 498980 | . United Kingdom | 64088222 | 0.54 | 241930 | . Thailand | 67976405 | 0.34 | 510890 | . Italy | 61855120 | 0.27 | 294140 | . Germany | 80854408 | 0.17 | 348672 | . Japan | 126919659 | 0.16 | 364485 | . Korea, South | 49115196 | 0.14 | 96920 | . Poland | 38562189 | 0.09 | 304255 | . Since the countries in this table have above-average population size and below-average land area, these may be at risk of facing high population density in the future. This may be especially true for those with the highest population growth rates, such as Uganda, Iraq, and the Philippines. . If we want to know which countries already have a high population density, though, we can run the query below. It calculates the population density as population size over land area, and then it displays the countries with the top 10 highest population densities. . %%sql result &lt;&lt; SELECT name, population, population_growth, area_land, population / area_land AS &quot;population_density&quot; FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ORDER BY population_density DESC ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. Returning data to local variable result . The resulting DataFrame is shown below. We have added 2 additional columns which will help us in making a chart: . place: Whether the country is in the top 10 countries in terms of population density. | text: The text to display for each country. | . pop_density = result.DataFrame() # Place variable pop_density[&quot;place&quot;] = [&quot;Top 10&quot;] * 10 + [&quot;Below Top 10&quot;] * (len(pop_density) - 10) # Text variable pop_density[&quot;text&quot;] = ( pop_density[&quot;name&quot;].copy() # Append text that indicates the numeric place of the country. .str.cat([&quot; (Top {})&quot;.format(i) for i in range(1, len(pop_density) + 1)]) ) # Make the text blank for the countries below the top 10. pop_density.loc[ pop_density[&quot;place&quot;] == &quot;Below Top 10&quot;, &quot;text&quot; ] = &quot;&quot; pop_density.head(11) . name population population_growth area_land population_density place text . 0 Macau | 592731.0 | 0.80 | 28.0 | 21168.0 | Top 10 | Macau (Top 1) | . 1 Monaco | 30535.0 | 0.12 | 2.0 | 15267.0 | Top 10 | Monaco (Top 2) | . 2 Singapore | 5674472.0 | 1.89 | 687.0 | 8259.0 | Top 10 | Singapore (Top 3) | . 3 Hong Kong | 7141106.0 | 0.38 | 1073.0 | 6655.0 | Top 10 | Hong Kong (Top 4) | . 4 Gaza Strip | 1869055.0 | 2.81 | 360.0 | 5191.0 | Top 10 | Gaza Strip (Top 5) | . 5 Gibraltar | 29258.0 | 0.24 | 6.0 | 4876.0 | Top 10 | Gibraltar (Top 6) | . 6 Bahrain | 1346613.0 | 2.41 | 760.0 | 1771.0 | Top 10 | Bahrain (Top 7) | . 7 Maldives | 393253.0 | 0.08 | 298.0 | 1319.0 | Top 10 | Maldives (Top 8) | . 8 Malta | 413965.0 | 0.31 | 316.0 | 1310.0 | Top 10 | Malta (Top 9) | . 9 Bermuda | 70196.0 | 0.50 | 54.0 | 1299.0 | Top 10 | Bermuda (Top 10) | . 10 Bangladesh | 168957745.0 | 1.60 | 130170.0 | 1297.0 | Below Top 10 | | . The results above show the top 10 countries in terms of population density in people per square kilometer of land. Notably, Monaco and Gibraltar are cases of countries with under 10 square kilometers of land but also tens of thousands of people. On the other hand, Singapore and Hong Kong are cases of countries with a somewhat larger land area but huge population size due to urbanization. Hong Kong has the highest number of over 150 m tall buildings in the world, and Singapore has the 12th highest. . Jackson (2017) states that high population density in a place can lead to noise pollution, territorial behavior, and lack of personal space for the people there. Thus, these may be significant challenges for the countries listed above. . Continuing on, we can take our analysis a step further by investigating countries with both high population density and high population growth rate. Such countries may be at risk of further aggravation of population density issues. . # Base layer with x and y axes base = ( alt.Chart(pop_density) .mark_point() .encode( x = alt.X( &quot;area_land:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Land Area (Square Kilometers)&quot;, scale = alt.Scale(domain = (0, 1100)), # Limit the x and y axis domains. # We will zoom in on the part of the chart that shows the important points. ), y = alt.Y( &quot;population:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Population Size&quot;, scale = alt.Scale(domain = (0, 6000000)), ), ) ) # Scatter plot layer points = ( base .encode( # Express groupings using color and size. color = alt.Color(&quot;place:N&quot;, title = &quot;Category of Population Density&quot;), size = alt.Size(&quot;population_growth:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Population Growth Rate (% of Population)&quot;), # Provide a tooltip with extra information. tooltip = [ &quot;name&quot;, &quot;area_land&quot;, &quot;population&quot;, &quot;population_density&quot;, &quot;population_growth&quot;, ], ) ) # Text layer text = ( base .mark_text( align = &quot;center&quot;, baseline = &quot;middle&quot;, dx = 60, # Nudge text to the right. ) .encode( # Display the text variable. text = &quot;text&quot;, ) ) # Combine layers. chart = ( (points + text) .properties(title = &quot;Top 10 Countries in Population Density&quot;) .interactive() ) # Display chart. chart . . In the chart above, the orange points represent the top 10 countries in terms of population density, while the blue points represent the other countries. Larger points have a higher population growth rate. . Macau has the highest population density. However, Gaza Strip, Bahrain, and Singapore have higher population growth rates than Macau does (as indicated by the larger circles). This indicates that these countries&#39; population sizes may increase quickly, thus leading to increased population density and aggravating the issues that come with it. . Death Rate and Birth Rate . Our last query in SQL shall investigate which countries have a higher death rate than birth rate. Such countries may face a decrease in their population size. . Note that we will calculate a new variable, death_offset_birth, by subtracting birth rate from death rate. This variable is indicative of the net decrease in population (if only births and deaths are taken into account). . %%sql result &lt;&lt; SELECT name, population, population_growth, birth_rate, death_rate, death_rate - birth_rate AS &quot;death_offset_birth&quot; FROM facts WHERE name NOT IN (&quot;World&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;) ORDER BY death_offset_birth DESC ; . * sqlite:///2021-07-24-SQL-Fundamentals-Files/factbook.db Done. Returning data to local variable result . The result of the query is shown below. Additionally, we have created a new column, higher_category. This indicates whether the death rate or the birth rate is higher for a particular country. . db_rates = result.DataFrame() db_rates[&quot;higher_category&quot;] = ( db_rates[&quot;death_offset_birth&quot;] .apply(lambda x: &quot;Death Rate Higher&quot; if x &gt; 0 else &quot;Birth Rate Higher&quot;) ) db_rates.head(10) . name population population_growth birth_rate death_rate death_offset_birth higher_category . 0 Bulgaria | 7186893.0 | 0.58 | 8.92 | 14.44 | 5.52 | Death Rate Higher | . 1 Serbia | 7176794.0 | 0.46 | 9.08 | 13.66 | 4.58 | Death Rate Higher | . 2 Latvia | 1986705.0 | 1.06 | 10.00 | 14.31 | 4.31 | Death Rate Higher | . 3 Lithuania | 2884433.0 | 1.04 | 10.10 | 14.27 | 4.17 | Death Rate Higher | . 4 Ukraine | 44429471.0 | 0.60 | 10.72 | 14.46 | 3.74 | Death Rate Higher | . 5 Hungary | 9897541.0 | 0.22 | 9.16 | 12.73 | 3.57 | Death Rate Higher | . 6 Germany | 80854408.0 | 0.17 | 8.47 | 11.42 | 2.95 | Death Rate Higher | . 7 Slovenia | 1983412.0 | 0.26 | 8.42 | 11.37 | 2.95 | Death Rate Higher | . 8 Romania | 21666350.0 | 0.30 | 9.14 | 11.90 | 2.76 | Death Rate Higher | . 9 Croatia | 4464844.0 | 0.13 | 9.45 | 12.18 | 2.73 | Death Rate Higher | . The results above show the top 10 countries in terms of the difference between death rate and birth rate. At the top is Bulgaria; for every 1000 people each year, 14.44 die and 8.92 are born, meaning that deaths outnumber births by 5.52. . We can make an area chart in order to get an idea of the death rate situation for all countries. . Before that, though, how many countries have a death rate that is higher than the birth rate? . (db_rates[&quot;higher_category&quot;] == &quot;Death Rate Higher&quot;).sum() . 24 . There are 24 such countries. Thus, we can mention this fact in the chart title. . The chart is shown below. . ( alt.Chart(db_rates) .mark_area(point = True) # Show a point for each observation. .encode( x = alt.X(&quot;birth_rate:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Birth Rate (Births per 1000 People per Year)&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;death_offset_birth:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Death Rate offset by Birth Rate&quot;), color = alt.Color(&quot;higher_category:N&quot;, title = &quot;Higher Rate&quot;), tooltip = [ &quot;name&quot;, &quot;birth_rate&quot;, &quot;death_rate&quot;, &quot;death_offset_birth&quot;, ], ) .properties(title = &quot;Death Rate is Higher than Birth Rate for 24 Countries&quot;) .interactive() ) . . In the chart above, each point represents a country. Click, drag, and scroll in order to explore the countries and read their tooltips. . The horizontal line marks the spot where the birth rate and death rate are equal—they cancel each other out. The blue part represents the majority of countries, which have a birth rate higher than the death rate. On the other hand, the orange part represents the 24 countries where deaths outnumber births. . Interestingly, there is a downward trend in the chart. Death rate offset by birth rate appears to have a strong negative correlation with birth rate. . More importantly, one would expect the 24 highlighted countries to have a negative population growth. However, if we look at the table, the population growth rates are still positive. This means that other factors such as migration may be involved in keeping the population growing rather than shrinking. . Summary . In this project, we used a local database file of CIA World Factbook data about 259 countries. We explored the topics of population size, growth rate, raw increase, and density, as well as death rate and birth rate. We queried the database with SQL in order to calculate summary statistics and generate tables showing the top countries with certain characteristics. After identifying countries of interest, we did a little research on each one in order to understand why it had such characteristics. Lastly, we created interesting interactive charts that highlighted the countries of interest. These charts allowed the viewer to read extra information about each country via tooltips. .

            "title": "How Student Demographic Affects SAT Performance in NYC",
            "content": "Unsplash | Nguyen Dang Hoang Nhu Overview . Updated on July 21, 2021. . The SAT, or Scholastic Assessment Test, is taken by many high school students in the USA and around the world before college applications. SAT scores are one of the kinds of information used by colleges to determine a student&#39;s level of college readiness. . However, the SAT has faced controversy due to analyses which have shown that students&#39; demographics - such as sex, race, socio-economic status - may have influenced their SAT performance. . Thus, the goal of this project is to determine the ways in which New York City high school students&#39; demographics may affect SAT performance. Towards this end, we have: . Downloaded various datasets on NYC high schools from NYC Open Data | Cleaned, transformed, and combined these datasets into one DataFrame | Conducted exploratory data analysis and visualizations | Performed multiple linear regression | . The final regression model explained 78.6% of the variance (R2= 0.786, F(6, 394) = 96.44, p &lt; 0.01). The percentage of each race in a school significantly predicted each school&#39;s average SAT score. . . Note: I wrote this notebook for the Dataquest course&#8217;s Guided Project: Analyzing NYC High School Data. The general project flow and research questions came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. . Package Installs . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns import statsmodels.api as sm import statsmodels.stats.api as sms import re . Data Transformation and Cleaning . In this section, we transform some columns in each dataset in order to get useful values. Then, we combine all of the datasets into one DataFrame. Some data cleaning will also be performed throughout the process. This is necessary in order to perform analysis using all of the columns available. . List of Datasets . The following are the datasets that were downloaded from NYC Open Data for this project. The files were renamed to have shorter names. . sat_results.csv: 2012 SAT results (link) | hs_directory: 2010 - 2011 School Attendance and Enrollment Statistics by District (link) | class_size.csv: 2010-2011 Class Size - School-level detail (link) | ap_2010.csv: 2010 AP (College Board) School Level Results (link) | graduation.csv: 2005-2010 Graduation Outcomes - School Level (link) | demographics.csv: 2006 - 2012 School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot (link) | survey_all.txt, survey_d75.txt: 2011 NYC School Survey (link) | . The code below reads the CSVs into the program. . data_files = [ &quot;ap_2010.csv&quot;, &quot;class_size.csv&quot;, &quot;demographics.csv&quot;, &quot;graduation.csv&quot;, &quot;hs_directory.csv&quot;, &quot;sat_results.csv&quot; ] data = {} for filename in data_files: key = filename[:-4] # Remove &quot;.csv&quot; df = pd.read_csv(&quot;./2021-06-13-HSD-Files/&quot; + filename) # Rename &quot;dbn&quot; to &quot;DBN&quot;. df = df.rename( {&quot;dbn&quot;: &quot;DBN&quot;}, axis = 1, ) # Assign the DataFrame to a key in the dictionary. data[key] = df . As for the TXT files, these are tab-delimited and encoded using Windows-1252 encoding, so we have to specify that when we read them in. We will also concatenate these two datasets vertically because these have the same column names. . all_survey = pd.read_csv( &quot;./2021-06-13-HSD-Files/survey_all.txt&quot;, delimiter = &quot; t&quot;, encoding = &quot;windows-1252&quot;, ) # Survey data on all District 75 schools. d75_survey = pd.read_csv( &quot;./2021-06-13-HSD-Files/survey_d75.txt&quot;, delimiter = &quot; t&quot;, encoding = &quot;windows-1252&quot;, ) # Concatenate the two datasets vertically into one dataset. survey = pd.concat( [all_survey, d75_survey], axis = 0, ) # Rename &quot;dbn&quot; column to &quot;DBN&quot; for consistency. survey = survey.rename( {&quot;dbn&quot;: &quot;DBN&quot;}, axis = 1, ) # Put the DataFrame into the main dictionary. data[&quot;survey&quot;] = survey . Now, all of the datasets can be accessed via the data Series. . data = pd.Series(data) list(data.index) . [&#39;ap_2010&#39;, &#39;class_size&#39;, &#39;demographics&#39;, &#39;graduation&#39;, &#39;hs_directory&#39;, &#39;sat_results&#39;, &#39;survey&#39;] . To give an idea of what these datasets look like, we show the first few rows of the SAT results dataset below. . Each row contains data on one school. | Each column provides a different detail about the schools, such as school name, number of test takers in each school, etc. | . data.sat_results.head() . DBN SCHOOL NAME Num of SAT Test Takers SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score SAT Math Avg. Score SAT Writing Avg.

SAT Total Scores . The SAT results dataset contains columns showing the average score in each section of the test. . However, there is no column representing the average SAT total score. This is important to know because it gauges a student&#39;s overall mastery of high school knowledge and college preparedness. . Thus, we will generate a total score column by taking the sum of the three section score columns. . score_cols = [ &quot;SAT Math Avg. Score&quot;, &quot;SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score&quot;, &quot;SAT Writing Avg. Score&quot;, ] # Convert each column from string to numeric. for col in score_cols: data.sat_results[col] = pd.to_numeric( data.sat_results[col], errors = &quot;coerce&quot;, # Set invalid parsing as NaN. ) # Get the total scores by summing the 3 section scores. data.sat_results[&quot;sat_score&quot;] = ( data.sat_results[score_cols] .sum( axis = 1, skipna = False, # Return NaN if the row has a NaN. ) ) # Drop rows with missing values. data.sat_results.dropna(inplace = True) data.sat_results[score_cols + [&quot;sat_score&quot;]].head() .

The sat_score column now shows each school&#39;s average SAT total score. . School Location . Another piece of information we want to find is the set of geographical coordinates of each NYC school. We can find this using the hs_directory dataset, which has a Location 1 column. . data.hs_directory[[&quot;DBN&quot;, &quot;school_name&quot;, &quot;Location 1&quot;]].head() .

Each value is a string with three lines. The third line contains the school&#39;s latitude and longitude in parentheses. . We can extract the coordinate data using the regular expression ((.+) ). This matches a pair of parentheses containing 1 or more characters between them. . def get_coords(text, which = 0): &quot;&quot;&quot;Take a string, extract coordinates, and return one of the values.&quot;&quot;&quot; pattern = r&quot; ((.+) )&quot; # Regex extracted = re.findall(pattern, text) # Returns a list of extracted strings coords = extracted[0].split(&quot;, &quot;) # Split string into list of strings # Return one of the coordinates as a float64. result = np.float64(coords[which]) return result # Make latitude and longitude columns. data.hs_directory[&quot;lat&quot;] = ( data.hs_directory[&quot;Location 1&quot;] .apply(get_coords, which = 0) ) data.hs_directory[&quot;lon&quot;] = ( data.hs_directory[&quot;Location 1&quot;] .apply(get_coords, which = 1) ) data.hs_directory[[&quot;lat&quot;, &quot;lon&quot;]].head() . lat lon . 0 40.670299 | -73.961648 | . 1 40.827603 | -73.904475 | . 2 40.842414 | -73.916162 | . 3 40.710679 | -74.000807 | . 4 40.718810 | -73.806500 | . We have successfully extracted the latitude and longitude from each string. . Survey Dataset Columns . Another issue is that there are too many columns in the survey dataset: . data.survey.shape . (1702, 2773) . There are 2773 columns. The reason is that each column represents a different survey item or option. It appears that the survey had many items. . However, if we look at the data dictionary, we can see that there are only a few very important columns: . important_fields = [ # Unique DBN of each school &quot;DBN&quot;, # Response rates &quot;rr_s&quot;, &quot;rr_t&quot;, &quot;rr_p&quot;, &quot;N_s&quot;, &quot;N_t&quot;, &quot;N_p&quot;, # Scores about various aspects of the school experience &quot;saf_p_11&quot;, &quot;com_p_11&quot;, &quot;eng_p_11&quot;, &quot;aca_p_11&quot;, &quot;saf_t_11&quot;, &quot;com_t_11&quot;, &quot;eng_t_11&quot;, &quot;aca_t_11&quot;, &quot;saf_s_11&quot;, &quot;com_s_11&quot;, &quot;eng_s_11&quot;, &quot;aca_s_11&quot;, &quot;saf_tot_11&quot;, &quot;com_tot_11&quot;, &quot;eng_tot_11&quot;, &quot;aca_tot_11&quot;, ] . Thus, we will only keep these columns in survey and remove the rest. . data.survey = data.survey[important_fields] . DBN Column . Earlier, we saw that the first column in the sat_results dataset was DBN. . data.sat_results.head() . DBN SCHOOL NAME Num of SAT Test Takers SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score SAT Math Avg. Score SAT Writing Avg. Score sat_score . 0 01M292 | HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES | 29 | 355.0 | 404.0 | 363.0 | 1122.0 | . 1 01M448 | UNIVERSITY NEIGHBORHOOD HIGH SCHOOL | 91 | 383.0 | 423.0 | 366.0 | 1172.0 | . 2 01M450 | EAST SIDE COMMUNITY SCHOOL | 70 | 377.0 | 402.0 | 370.0 | 1149.0 | . 3 01M458 | FORSYTH SATELLITE ACADEMY | 7 | 414.0 | 401.0 | 359.0 | 1174.0 | . 4 01M509 | MARTA VALLE HIGH SCHOOL | 44 | 390.0 | 433.0 | 384.0 | 1207.0 | . The DBN, or District Borough Number, is a unique code that identifies each school in NYC. . Since it is unique to each school, we can use it to match rows across our datasets and combine them into one. However, the class_size dataset doesn&#39;t have a DBN column. . data.class_size.head() .

By comparing the sat_results dataset to the class_size dataset, we can see that the DBN is actually a combination of: . the CSD (Community School District), like &quot;01&quot;. | the School Code, like &quot;M015&quot;. | . The CSD must have two digits, so single-digit CSDs need to be padded with a zero in front. This is done below. . def zero_pad(num): &quot;&quot;&quot;Zero-pad a number if it only has 1 digit.&quot;&quot;&quot; digits = len(str(num)) if digits == 1: zero_padded = str(num).zfill(2) return zero_padded elif digits == 2: return str(num) else: raise ValueError(&quot;Invalid number of digits.&quot;) data.class_size[&quot;padded_csd&quot;] = data.class_size[&quot;CSD&quot;].apply(zero_pad) data.class_size[[&quot;CSD&quot;, &quot;padded_csd&quot;, &quot;SCHOOL CODE&quot;]].head() .

Now, we can combine padded_csd and SCHOOL CODE to make the DBN. . data.class_size[&quot;DBN&quot;] = ( data.class_size[[&quot;padded_csd&quot;, &quot;SCHOOL CODE&quot;]] .sum(axis = 1) # Add values along rows. ) # Reorder the df so that DBN is in front. def reorder_columns(df, first_cols): &quot;&quot;&quot;Take a DataFrame and a list of columns.

We were successful in creating a DBN column for the class size dataset. . Condensing Datasets . Another issue that needs to be addressed is that some datasets have multiple rows with the same DBN. For example, look at the frequency table of DBN values in class_size. . data.class_size[&quot;DBN&quot;].value_counts() . 15K429 57 09X517 56 09X505 56 21K690 52 15K448 52 .. 03M452 3 24Q290 3 02M267 2 27Q465 2 09X090 2 Name: DBN, Length: 1487, dtype: int64 . Each DBN appears at least twice in the dataset. This would be problematic when merging it with other datasets, since each row must have a unique DBN value. . Therefore, we need to condense class_size and other such datasets so that the DBN value is unique to each row. . The code below identifies which columns need to be condensed based on the frequency of its DBN values. . [ df_name for df_name in data.index if data[df_name][&quot;DBN&quot;].value_counts().max() &gt; 1 # Check if any DBN values appear more than once. ] . [&#39;ap_2010&#39;, &#39;class_size&#39;, &#39;demographics&#39;, &#39;graduation&#39;] . The 4 datasets listed above will be condensed one by one. . Advanced Placement Dataset . First, the ap_2010 dataset will be condensed. It contains data on AP (Advanced Placement) test results in 2010. . print(data.ap_2010.shape) data.ap_2010.head() . (258, 5) .

From the first five rows, it is not immediately clear why DBN values repeat. The DBNs are unique in this sample. . Let&#39;s check the frequency table of DBN values. . data.ap_2010[&quot;DBN&quot;].value_counts() . 04M610 2 11X253 1 32K552 1 09X263 1 11X249 1 .. 12X690 1 31R445 1 25Q285 1 11X288 1 11X415 1 Name: DBN, Length: 257, dtype: int64 . This frequency table is ordered by frequency, descending. Thus, we can tell that 04M610 is the only DBN that repeats in this dataset. Let&#39;s inspect the 2 rows with this DBN. . data.ap_2010.loc[ data.ap_2010[&quot;DBN&quot;] == &quot;04M610&quot; ] .

It looks like the duplication was caused by a simple error in data entry. Row 51 is valid, whereas row 52 has an incomplete school name. It also has a string &quot;s&quot; in numerical columns; this is invalid data. . Thus, we will drop row 52 from the dataset. . data.ap_2010.drop(52, inplace = True) data.ap_2010[&quot;DBN&quot;].value_counts().max() . 1 . Now that we&#39;ve dropped the inaccurate row, none of the DBN values repeat. . As a side note, since there were &quot;s&quot; strings in the numerical columns, we realize that these are object-type columns. Thus, we have to convert these into numerical columns in order to perform analysis on them later on. . cols = [&#39;AP Test Takers &#39;, &#39;Total Exams Taken&#39;, &#39;Number of Exams with scores 3 4 or 5&#39;] for col in cols: # Convert each column to numerical format. data.ap_2010[col] = pd.to_numeric( data.ap_2010[col], errors = &quot;coerce&quot;, # In case of errors, use NaN values. ) data.ap_2010.dtypes . DBN object SchoolName object AP Test Takers float64 Total Exams Taken float64 Number of Exams with scores 3 4 or 5 float64 dtype: object . The numerical columns were successfully converted into float64 (decimal) format. . Class Size Dataset . Next, we will condense the class_size dataset. It contains aggregated data on the number of students in classes in NYC schools. . Why are there rows with duplicate DBNs? Let&#39;s look at the first few rows. . print(data.class_size.shape) data.class_size.head() . (27611, 17) .

Look at the GRADE and PROGRAM TYPE columns. Each school&#39;s data is split by grade level, from K to 12. The data are further split by the program type (GEN ED, CTT, etc.). That&#39;s why each DBN has multiple rows. . In our case, we are only concerned with high school students&#39; data (grades 9 to 12) since the SAT is taken at this level of education. Let&#39;s see which GRADE value/s correspond to high school. . data.class_size[&quot;GRADE &quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 01 1185 02 1167 03 1143 04 1140 05 1086 06 846 07 778 08 735 09 20 09-12 10644 0K 1237 0K-09 1384 MS Core 4762 Name: GRADE , dtype: int64 . Conveniently, there is a 09-12 value. Rows with this value would contain aggregated data on all high school grade levels. Thus, we will filter the class_size dataset to keep only these rows. . There is still the issue of the PROGRAM TYPE column, however. Let&#39;s look at its frequency table. . data.class_size[&quot;PROGRAM TYPE&quot;].value_counts() . GEN ED 14545 CTT 7460 SPEC ED 3653 G&amp;T 469 Name: PROGRAM TYPE, dtype: int64 . There are hundreds or thousands of rows under each program type. According to the data dictionary, the following are the meanings of these values: . GEN ED: General Education | CTT: Collaborative Team Teaching | SPEC ED: Special Education | G&amp;T: Gifted &amp; Talented | . The General Education program best represents the majority of high school students, and this is the most frequent program in the data. Thus, we will keep the GEN ED rows and drop the rest. . To recap, we chose to filter the dataset to keep rows where the grade level is from 9 to 12 and the program type is General Education. We will do this using the code below. . data.class_size = data.class_size.loc[ (data.class_size[&quot;GRADE &quot;] == &quot;09-12&quot;) &amp; (data.class_size[&quot;PROGRAM TYPE&quot;] == &quot;GEN ED&quot;) ] print(data.class_size.shape) data.class_size.head() .

The first few rows of the dataset show us that we were successful in filtering rows by GRADE and PROGRAM TYPE. From 27611 rows, we have narrowed the dataset down to 6513 rows. . However, there are still duplicate DBN values. The new problem is that the data are divided by the following columns: . CORE SUBJECT (MS CORE and 9-12 ONLY) | CORE COURSE (MS CORE and 9-12 ONLY) | . These columns contain the specific subject or course of the class. We want to get class size data that accounts for all subjects, so we cannot simply filter the dataset by 1 subject. . Instead, we will: . Group the data by DBN value. | Aggregate the numerical data by taking the mean of each column in each group. | . data.class_size = ( data.class_size .groupby(&quot;DBN&quot;) # Group by the school&#39;s unique DBN .agg(np.mean) # Aggregate numerical columns using mean .reset_index() # Put the DBN column back in the df ) print(data.class_size.shape) data.class_size.head() .

As expected, the cohorts range from 2001 to 2006. There also appears to be an extra value representing August of 2006. . Since we can only keep 1 row from each school, it is best to keep the 2006 rows since these are the most recent. . data.graduation = data.graduation.loc[ data.graduation[&quot;Cohort&quot;] == &quot;2006&quot; ] print(data.graduation.shape) data.graduation.head() .

After the dataset was filtered for the second time, it was left with 405 rows. . Let&#39;s check the maximum frequency of DBNs again. . data.graduation[&quot;DBN&quot;].value_counts().max() . 1 . The DBNs are now unique to each row in the dataset. . Column Names . We&#39;re almost at the point where we can combine the datasets. However, the final dataset would have many columns. It would be good to be able to know which dataset each column came from. Thus, we will use the following prefix system: . A_: The ap_2010 dataset | C_: The class_size dataset | D_: The demographics dataset | G_: The graduation dataset | H_: The hs_directory dataset | R_: The sat_results dataset | S_: The survey dataset | . I add these prefixes using the code below. . for df_name in data.index: # Take the first letter, capitalize it, and append an underscore. if df_name == &quot;sat_results&quot;: prefix = &quot;R_&quot; else: prefix = df_name[0].upper() + &quot;_&quot; # Add the prefix to each column label. df = data[df_name] non_dbn = [col for col in df if col != &quot;DBN&quot;] dbn_col = df[[&quot;DBN&quot;]] other_cols = df[non_dbn].add_prefix(prefix) # Put the df back into the data Series. data[df_name] = pd.concat( [dbn_col, other_cols], axis = 1, ) .

We will start with the sat_results dataset as the first &quot;left&quot; dataset in the merging process. . We will consider two ways to merge datasets: . Left join: Keep all rows in the &quot;left&quot; dataset, but remove rows in the &quot;right&quot; dataset if their DBNs had no match. | Inner join: Only keep rows where the DBN exists in both datasets. | . Before we choose, though, we will have to find out whether the DBNs in sat_results match the ones present in other datasets. . Heatmap of DBNs . In previous Dataquest guided projects, heatmaps were sometimes used to visualize correlation tables and missing values. I realized that this could be extended to the situation of the DBNs. . What if we created a DataFrame where: . The columns represent the 7 datasets. | The indices represent the unique DBNs. | Each value is True if the DBN appears in the specific dataset, else False. | . Then, we would be able to create a heatmap to visualize which DBNs were present and absent in each dataset. . I wrote the code below in order to make the DataFrame. . col_list = [] for df_name in data.index: dbn = data[df_name][[&quot;DBN&quot;]] # Get a 1-column DataFrame of DBN values. new_col = dbn.set_index(&quot;DBN&quot;) # Set the DBNs as the indices. There are no columns now. new_col[df_name] = 1 # Create a new column of ones. col_list.append(new_col) # Append the column to the list. # Combine the columns into one DataFrame. dbn_grid = pd.concat( col_list, axis = 1, ).notnull() # Replace values with False if they&#39;re null, else True. dbn_grid.head() . ap_2010 class_size demographics graduation hs_directory sat_results survey . DBN . 01M448 True | True | True | True | True | True | True | . 01M450 True | True | True | True | True | True | True | . 01M515 True | True | True | True | False | True | True | . 01M539 True | True | True | True | True | True | True | . 02M296 True | True | True | True | True | True | True | . Let&#39;s take the top left cell as an example. Its value is True. This means that the DBN 01M448 appears in the ap_2010 dataset. . Since SAT performance is our focus, we can filter the rows in the DataFrame to only include the ones where the DBN is present in sat_results. . dbn_grid = dbn_grid.loc[ dbn_grid[&quot;sat_results&quot;] # Keep rows where this column contains True values. ] . Now, we can plot our heatmap. Above it, we will also print a table of the exact number of relevant DBNs present in each dataset. . print(&quot;Counts of relevant DBNs in each dataset&quot;) print(dbn_grid.sum()) # Initiate the figure plt.figure(figsize = (15, 5)) # Create a heatmap of the boolean dataframe sns.heatmap( dbn_grid, cbar = True, # Include a color bar. yticklabels = False, # Do not show y-tick labels. ) plt.title(&quot;Heatmap of Relevant DBN Values in each Dataset&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Dataset&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 0) plt.show() . Counts of relevant DBNs in each dataset ap_2010 251 class_size 401 demographics 412 graduation 381 hs_directory 339 sat_results 421 survey 418 dtype: int64 . Each column in the heatmap corresponds to one of our 7 datasets. The y-axis represents the unique DBNs. . The DBNs present in a dataset are represented by a light brown color. The missing DBNs are represented by black. . The following can be observed: . The sat_results dataset is complete since we are using it as our basis for which DBNs are &quot;relevant.&quot; There are 421 relevant DBNs in total. | The ap_2010 dataset has the least DBNs, only 251. | hs_directory and graduation have missing DBNs scattered around. They have less than 400 DBNs each. | class_size, demographics, and survey are the most complete datasets, with over 400 DBNs. | . This information will help us in choosing how to merge the datasets. . Left join . The advantage of performing a left join is apparent when the &quot;right&quot; dataset has many missing DBN values. . With a left join, all of the sat_results rows would be kept. | With an inner join, the number of rows would be significantly reduced. | . We saw that ap_2010, hs_directory, and graduation have the most missing DBN values, so these are good candidates for a left join. These 3 datasets provide information that is supplementary but not very crucial to our analysis, so it is fine for some rows to contain missing values. . combined = data.sat_results for df_name in [&quot;ap_2010&quot;, &quot;hs_directory&quot;, &quot;graduation&quot;]: # Merge horizontally. combined = combined.merge( data[df_name], on = &quot;DBN&quot;, # Merge on DBN column how = &quot;left&quot;, # Left join ) print(combined.shape) combined.head() .

We&#39;ll analyze the data by going through each set of variables based on their original dataset. We&#39;ll only use the most important datasets. . Before we do this, we&#39;ll define a function that will take a Series and return values whose labels have certain prefixes. This will help us select parts of the correlation table more easily. . def filter_prefix(series, regex): &quot;&quot;&quot;Takes a Series and a regex. Returns items in the Series whose labels match the regex at the start.&quot;&quot;&quot; result = series[[ label for label in series.index if re.match(regex, label) ]] return result .

Let&#39;s proceed to the first set of variables. . AP Exam Results . First, we&#39;ll look at the correlations for ap_2010 variables. . filter_prefix(sat_corr, r&quot;[A]&quot;) . A_AP Test Takers 0.625184 A_Total Exams Taken 0.614112 A_Number of Exams with scores 3 4 or 5 0.614752 Name: R_sat_score, dtype: float64 . The number of AP test takers has a positive correlation of 0.63 with SAT score. . Remember that the AP exams are &quot;Advanced Placement&quot; exams taken by USA high schoolers in order to get college credit. Thus, the students who take AP exams tend to have higher academic performance. . Let&#39;s make a scatter plot of SAT score against percentage of AP test takers in each school. . combined[&quot;A_ap_perc&quot;] = combined[&quot;A_AP Test Takers &quot;] / combined[&quot;D_total_enrollment&quot;] # Replace inaccurate data (above 100%) with nulls. combined[&quot;A_ap_perc&quot;] = combined[&quot;A_ap_perc&quot;].mask( combined[&quot;A_ap_perc&quot;] &gt; 1.0, np.nan, ) # Scatter plot combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;A_ap_perc&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs AP Test Taker Percentage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;AP Test Taker Percentage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The relationship is not linear. We can only observe that: . Most schools have less than 40% AP takers and less than 1400 SAT points. | The schools with high SAT scores (above 1600) have less than 60% AP test takers. | The schools with low SAT scores (under 1400) can have any percentage of AP test takers. | . Therefore, it doesn&#39;t seem that the percentage of AP test takers in a school reliably influences its average SAT score. . Survey Data . Let&#39;s move on to the survey variables. . filter_prefix(sat_corr, r&quot;[S]&quot;) . S_rr_s 0.286470 S_rr_t 0.022365 S_rr_p 0.087970 S_N_s 0.438427 S_N_t 0.306520 S_N_p 0.439547 S_saf_p_11 0.111892 S_com_p_11 -0.106899 S_eng_p_11 0.016640 S_aca_p_11 0.026691 S_saf_t_11 0.315796 S_com_t_11 0.097797 S_eng_t_11 0.045746 S_aca_t_11 0.135490 S_saf_s_11 0.286153 S_com_s_11 0.157417 S_eng_s_11 0.174425 S_aca_s_11 0.292592 S_saf_tot_11 0.292468 S_com_tot_11 0.083068 S_eng_tot_11 0.093489 S_aca_tot_11 0.178388 Name: R_sat_score, dtype: float64 . The variable names are abbreviated, so it is difficult to understand them. However, the data dictionary explains their meanings. . The most important ones are from S_saf_p_11 downwards. These variables represent scores of 4 aspects of each school: . Safety and Respect | Communication | Engagement | Academic Expectations | . Each aspect has 4 scores based on the respondent group: parents, teachers, students, and total (all groups). . For example, S_saf_tot_11 refers to the total Safety and Respect score of a school. It had a coefficient of 0.29. Let&#39;s see a scatterplot of this. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;S_saf_tot_11&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs Safety and Respect Score (Total)&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Safety and Respect Score (Total)&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The correlation is not strong, as many schools have SAT scores under 1400 regardless of Safety and Respect score. . The schools which did have high scores (above 1500) had safety scores ranging from 7.25 to 8.75. This suggests that having sufficient safety and respect in a school may support the learning experience, though it does not always increase SAT scores. . Another interesting variable would be S_aca_s_11, the Academic Expectations score based on student responses. It had a coefficient of 0.29. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;S_aca_s_11&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs Academic Expectations Score (Students)&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Academic Expectations Score (Students)&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Again, the correlation is not strong. . It&#39;s interesting to note, however, that none of the schools with an Academic Expectations score under 7.5 had SAT scores above 1600. We could say that a school must first have proper academic expectations in order to open the opportunity to excel. . In terms of strong conclusions, though, we can&#39;t make any yet. . Demographics . Lastly, we go to the demographics dataset variables. These are the most important variables to investigate for this project. . Here are the correlation coefficients: . filter_prefix(sat_corr, r&quot;[D]&quot;) . D_frl_percent -0.718163 D_total_enrollment 0.385741 D_ell_num -0.130355 D_ell_percent -0.379510 D_sped_num 0.058782 D_sped_percent -0.420646 D_asian_num 0.483939 D_asian_per 0.552204 D_black_num 0.043408 D_black_per -0.302794 D_hispanic_num 0.052672 D_hispanic_per -0.363696 D_white_num 0.460505 D_white_per 0.646568 D_male_num 0.345808 D_male_per -0.107624 D_female_num 0.403581 D_female_per 0.107676 Name: R_sat_score, dtype: float64 . The results can be divided into general topics: . School size: The total_enrollment has a coefficient of 0.39. This means that bigger schools may have higher SAT scores. | English proficiency: The coefficient for ELL percentage is -0.38. ELL means English Language Learner. It refers to students who are learning as a second or third language because they did not grow up with it. | . | SpEd percentage: The coefficient for SpEd percentage is -0.42. SpEd means Special Education. It refers to educational plans with special accommodations for students who are disabled or have developmental disorders. | . | Sex: The following are the coefficients of the percentage of each sex: Male: -0.11 | Female: 0.11 | . | Race: The following are the coefficients related to the percentage of students belonging to specific races. Asian: 0.55 | Black: -0.30 | Hispanic: -0.36 | White: 0.65 | . | Socio-economic status: The coefficient for FRL percentage -0.72. FRL means Free or Reduced-Price Lunch. This is a program that supports students below a certain income threshold who do not have the means to bring their own lunch to school. | . | . We will go through each topic one by one. . School Size . Below, we plot a scatter plot of SAT scores against the total number of enrollees in each school. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;D_total_enrollment&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs Total Enrollment&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Total Enrollment&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The scatter plot doesn&#39;t have a clear linear trend. Instead, the majority of points are clustered in one area, and the rest of the points are scattered. . Let&#39;s inspect the names of the schools at the very bottom left, which have SAT scores under 1000 and total enrollment under 1000. . combined.loc[ (combined[&quot;R_sat_score&quot;] &lt; 1000) &amp; (combined[&quot;D_total_enrollment&quot;] &lt; 1000), &quot;R_SCHOOL NAME&quot; ] . 102 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL 138 ACADEMY FOR LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY 139 BRONX INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL 153 KINGSBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL 155 INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL FOR LIBERAL ARTS 197 PAN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL AT MONROE 199 HIGH SCHOOL OF WORLD CULTURES 210 BROOKLYN INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL 241 PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL 251 INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL AT PROSPECT HEIGHTS 266 IT TAKES A VILLAGE ACADEMY 285 MULTICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL 314 ASPIRATIONS DIPLOMA PLUS HIGH SCHOOL 320 PAN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL Name: R_SCHOOL NAME, dtype: object . Interestingly, the schools with the lowest average SAT scores are mostly small international schools. These schools tend to have more students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. These students may speak English as a second or third language. . Therefore, the factor that affected SAT performance may have been the percentage of English language learners (ELL) in each school. This makes sense since the SAT is offered only in English and includes sections on Reading and Writing. . English Proficiency . Let&#39;s plot SAT scores against the percentage of ELLs (English Language Learners) in each school. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;D_ell_percent&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs ELL Percentage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;ELL Percentage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Once again, there isn&#39;t a linear trend even though the correlation coefficient between the variables was -0.38. However, we can note that: . Most schools have less than 50% ELLs and less than 1400 SAT points. | The schools with the highest SAT scores (over 1500) have almost 0% ELLs. | All of the schools with over 50% ELLs have very low scores (under 1300). | . Therefore, it appears that ELL students are more challenged in reaching high SAT scores. . SpEd Percentage . The coefficient for SpEd percentage was -0.42, which indicates that schools with more SpEd students may have lower SAT scores. Let&#39;s view a scatter plot: . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;D_sped_percent&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs SpEd Percentage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;SpEd Percentage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The correlation is somewhat linear, but it is not very steep. The points are very scattered, especially on the left side. Interestingly, the schools with an SAT score over 1600 had 15% or less SpEd students. . However, the variable doesn&#39;t predict SAT score well. . Sex . Another factor that&#39;s important to investigate is sex. Do schools with more male students or more female students have higher SAT scores? . Earlier, we saw that the male and female percentages had weak correlations with SAT score. . Male: -0.11; lower SAT scores. | Female: 0.11; higher SAT scores. | . However, these correlations are weak, so the difference may not be that great. . Let&#39;s use the female_per variable in a scatter plot. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;D_female_per&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs Female Percentage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Female Percentage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . As expected, the correlation is weak. We can see that: . In most schools, 40% to 60% of students are female. | SAT score is typically below 1400 regardless of female percentage. | The schools with the highest SAT scores (above 1500) have a 30% to 75% female population. | . This variable doesn&#39;t seem to be very important to SAT score. . Race . Earlier, we saw that the following were the coefficients for race percentage variables. Positive values imply that a higher percentage of the given race may lead to higher average SAT score. Negative values: lower score. . Asian: 0.55 | Black: -0.30 | Hispanic: -0.36 | White: 0.65 | . Out of all 4, the white percentage value has the strongest correlation, 0.65. This means that having more white students in a school can lead to a higher average SAT score. Let&#39;s see a scatterplot of this. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;D_white_per&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs White Percentage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;White Percentage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Though the correlation coefficient was stronger than the others, the trend is loose; the points are scattered far away from each other. We can see that: . Most of the schools in the dataset have SAT scores under 1400 and white percentage under 20%. | The schools with the highest scores have white percentages ranging from under 10% to over 60%. | . Thus, we can&#39;t say that a higher white percentage definitely raises the average SAT score. . Since the other race-related variables are weaker than this one, we won&#39;t investigate them further. Let&#39;s move on to the topic of socio-economic status. . Socio-economic status . As mentioned earlier, there was a variable representing the percentage of students availing of FRL (Free or Reduced-Price Lunch). Since FRL is for students below an income threshold, we can consider it similar to a poverty rate. . The correlation coefficient for this variable is the strongest at -0.72. The FRL students may have lower SAT scores due to external difficulties associated with low socio-economic status which hinder their education. . Below is the scatterplot. . combined.plot.scatter( x = &quot;D_frl_percent&quot;, y = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;SAT Score vs FRL Percentage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;FRL Percentage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Average SAT Score&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . This graph shows a tighter, more linear relationship than was seen in the other graphs. . At the top left of the graph are schools with low FRL percentage and high average SAT score. There are still a few schools with an SAT score over 1600 despite an FRL percentage of over 50%. . However, for the majority of the schools, the FRL percentage is over 60%. All of these schools have an SAT score less than 1500. . Generally, the results suggest that socio-economic status is the strongest predictor of average SAT score among all variables in the dataset. High poverty rate is associated with a lower average SAT score. . Inferential Statistics: Linear Regression . As an additional step to this project, we will be performing Ordinary Least Squares linear regression. Some predictors may have a low Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient with the response variable but turn out to be statistically significant when other variables are taken into account. . I used Linear Regression by Python for Data Science LLC, along with (Simple) Linear Regression and OLS: Introduction to the Theory (Sluijmers 2020), as my main references. . The dataset has 401 observations. The dependent variable (or response variable) will be each school&#39;s average SAT total score, represented by R_sat_score. . As for independent variables (or predictor variables), we will start by considering the following. . English proficiency D_ell_percent | . | SpEd percentage D_sped_percent | . | Sex D_female_per | D_male_per | . | Race D_asian_per | D_black_per | D_hispanic_per | D_white_per | . | Socio-economic status D_frl_percent. | . | . The variable names are placed in the list below. . iv_list = [ &quot;D_ell_percent&quot;, &quot;D_sped_percent&quot;, &quot;D_female_per&quot;, &quot;D_male_per&quot;, &quot;D_asian_per&quot;, &quot;D_black_per&quot;, &quot;D_hispanic_per&quot;, &quot;D_white_per&quot;, &quot;D_frl_percent&quot;, ] . I&#39;d like to note that none of these columns have null values, so we don&#39;t have to drop any rows or perform imputation. . print(&quot;Null values in each column&quot;) combined[iv_list].isnull().sum() . Null values in each column . D_ell_percent 0 D_sped_percent 0 D_female_per 0 D_male_per 0 D_asian_per 0 D_black_per 0 D_hispanic_per 0 D_white_per 0 D_frl_percent 0 dtype: int64 . Moving on, the code below creates a matrix X for IVs and vector y for the DV. . regression_data = ( combined[[&quot;DBN&quot;, &quot;R_sat_score&quot;] + iv_list] .set_index(&quot;DBN&quot;) ) X = regression_data[iv_list].copy() y = regression_data[&quot;R_sat_score&quot;].copy() regression_data .

Before we fit and interpret the model with these DataFrames, we must first test the assumptions of linear regression. . Assumption 1: Multicollinearity . Multicollinearity occurs when multiple predictor variables are highly correlated. Variables with high multicollinearity have unreliable significance values. Thus, this is a problem that must be avoided. . The first way to check for multicollinearity is with a Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient table. The code below plots this table using a heatmap for easier interpretation. . corr = X.corr() # Create a mask that selects the bottom left triangle of the table. corr = corr.iloc[1:, :-1] mask = np.triu( # Replace the lower triangle with 0&#39;s. np.ones_like(corr), # Make a DataFrame of 1&#39;s with the same shape as corr. k = 1, # Raise the diagonal by 1. ) # Plot a heatmap of the values. plt.figure(figsize = (12, 7)) ax = sns.heatmap( corr, vmin = -1, # Anchor colors on -1 and 1. vmax = 1, cbar = True, # Draw a color bar. cmap = &quot;RdBu&quot;, # Use Red for negatives and Blue for positives. mask = mask, # Use a mask to remove the upper right triangle of the matrix. annot = True, # Write the data value in each cell. ) # Format the text in the plot to make it easier to read. for text in ax.texts: coeff = float(text.get_text()) # Remove data values with low correlation. if np.abs(coeff) &lt; 0.3: text.set_text(&#39;&#39;) # Round all visible data values to the hundredths place. else: text.set_text(round(coeff, 2)) text.set_fontsize(&quot;large&quot;) plt.title(&quot;Correlation Heatmap of Independent Variables&quot;) # Rotate x-ticks to read from top to bottom. plt.xticks(rotation = -30, ha = &quot;left&quot;, size = &quot;large&quot;) plt.yticks(rotation = 0, size = &quot;large&quot;) plt.show() . In the heatmap above, blue colors represent positive correlation; red represents negative correlation. Colors with more saturation indicate that the correlation is stronger. . I removed most of the coefficient labels except for the ones greater than 0.3, which show somewhat strong correlations. Interestingly, we can see that: . Male percentage has a perfect negative correlation with female percentage. This is to be expected since both must sum up to 100. | Hispanic percentage is correlated with black percentage and FRL percentage. | White percentage is strongly negatively correlated with FRL percentage, indicating that schools with more white students also have fewer poor students. | . Another way to assess multicollinearity is to use variance inflation factors or VIFs. These are numbers greater than or equal to 1. . A VIF less than 5 suggests low to moderate collinearity. If a predictor&#39;s VIF is at least 5, this indicates high multicollinearity, so the significance value is not reliable. . The code below produces a VIF for each predictor. . from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor as sm_vif def get_vif(X): &quot;&quot;&quot;Get a VIF value for each column in a DataFrame.&quot;&quot;&quot; vif_df = pd.DataFrame() vif_df[&quot;label&quot;] = X.columns vif_df[&quot;VIF&quot;] = [ sm_vif(X.values, i) for i in range(len(X.columns)) ] vif_df.set_index(&quot;label&quot;, inplace = True) return vif_df get_vif(X) . VIF . label . D_ell_percent 2.874752 | . D_sped_percent 8.509117 | . D_female_per 2578.305578 | . D_male_per 2569.217298 | . D_asian_per 304.520086 | . D_black_per 2196.055978 | . D_hispanic_per 2413.721821 | . D_white_per 231.186584 | . D_frl_percent 60.692762 | . These values are problematic. Almost all of the VIFs indicate strong multicollinearity except for that of D_ell_percent. This is likely due to the strong correlations we saw earlier in the heatmap. . Therefore, we must remove a few variables with high multicollinearity. . I choose to remove male_per since it has -1.0 correlation with female_per, which makes it redundant. | I choose to remove hispanic_per because it has over 0.5 correlation with black_per and frl_percent. | I choose to remove frl_percent since it has over 0.3 correlation with 4 other variables, including 0.7 correlation with white_per. | . Thus, below is the new list of predictors. . iv_list = [ &quot;D_ell_percent&quot;, &quot;D_sped_percent&quot;, &quot;D_female_per&quot;, &quot;D_asian_per&quot;, &quot;D_black_per&quot;, &quot;D_white_per&quot;, ] regression_data = ( combined[[&quot;DBN&quot;, &quot;R_sat_score&quot;] + iv_list] .set_index(&quot;DBN&quot;) ) X = regression_data[iv_list].copy() y = regression_data[&quot;R_sat_score&quot;].copy() vif_df = get_vif(X) vif_df . VIF . label . D_ell_percent 1.600755 | . D_sped_percent 3.824473 | . D_female_per 7.289758 | . D_asian_per 1.788134 | . D_black_per 3.926733 | . D_white_per 1.777499 | . We can see that most of the VIFs are less than 5, so the p-values in the model will be reliable. Only the female_per variable&#39;s p-value will be unreliable. However, I will still include this in the model since the percentages of sexes in a school may have an effect on SAT performance. . IID Errors and Normality of Residuals . Next, we will be testing two more assumptions: . IID (identically and independently distributed) residuals . This is tested using the Durbin-Watson test statistic, which ranges from 0 to 4. | Ideally, the statistic should be close to 2. | As a rule of thumb, values from 1.5 to 2.5 are considered acceptable. | . | Normality of residuals . This is tested using the Jarque-Bera test. | The null hypothesis is that the residuals are normally distributed. | A statistically significant value (p &lt; 0.05) supports the claim that the residuals are not normal. | . | . In order to test these, we must fit the model and look at its results. statsmodels automatically calculates both the Durbin-Watson and the Jarque-Bera tests for us. . # Add a constant to the X matrix. # This is done so that the y-intercept is not locked at 0. X = sm.add_constant(X) # Make and fit the OLS model. model = sm.OLS(y, X) results = model.fit() summary = results.summary() # Extract summary tables from OLS results summary. def extract_summary(sm_summary): &quot;&quot;&quot;Take a statsmodels summary instance and return a list of DataFrames.&quot;&quot;&quot; tables = [] t_inds = list(range(3)) for i in t_inds: table_as_html = sm_summary.tables[i].as_html() table_df = pd.read_html( table_as_html, header = (0 if i == 1 else None), # Only set a header for table 2. index_col = 0, )[0] tables.append(table_df) if i == 1: # Combine summary table 1 with the VIF column. table_df = pd.concat([table_df, vif_df], axis = 1) table_df.rename_axis(&quot;label&quot;, inplace = True) else: # For tables 0 and 2, turn the index back into a column. table_df = tables[i].reset_index() tables[i] = table_df return tables tables = extract_summary(summary) # Display the third table. tables[2] . 0 1 2 3 . 0 Omnibus: | 28.251 | Durbin-Watson: | 1.660000e+00 | . 1 Prob(Omnibus): | 0.000 | Jarque-Bera (JB): | 6.075100e+01 | . 2 Skew: | 0.378 | Prob(JB): | 6.430000e-14 | . 3 Kurtosis: | 4.751 | Cond. No. | 5.040000e+02 | . The Durbin-Watson test statistic is 1.66. This is less than 2, so it indicates positive autocorrelation among residuals. (That is, each residual has a positive correlation with the residual before it). However, it falls within the acceptable range (1.5 to 2.5), so it is not a cause for concern. . The Jarque-Bera test significance, on the other hand, is $6.43 cdot 10^{-14}$, which is very close to 0. It is statistically significant, so the residuals are not normally distributed. However, since the sample size (401) is greater than 30, OLS regression is robust against deviations from normality. Thus, this is not a cause for concern either. . Let&#39;s plot a histogram of residuals to inspect the deviation from normality, just to be sure. . residuals = results.resid #bin_edges = get_bin_edges(residuals) plt.hist(residuals, )#bins = bin_edges) plt.title(&quot;Histogram of Residuals&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Residual Error&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Frequency&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Though this isn&#39;t normal, it is still somewhat bell-shaped. Most of the data converges around a residual error of 0, with fewer values going farther away. Thus, the distribution isn&#39;t problematic. . We can also visualize normality of residuals using a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot. . sm.qqplot( data = residuals, line = &quot;r&quot;, # Regression line ) plt.title(&quot;Q-Q Plot of Residuals&quot;) plt.legend( labels = [&quot;Actual data&quot;, &quot;Theoretical quantiles line&quot;], loc = &quot;best&quot;, ) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The red line is our reference for normality. The blue dots should ideally follow this line. We can see that they do, though not perfectly, and the data are less normal at the higher quantiles. Generally, though, the data is close enough to being normal. . Lastly, for IID residuals, we can plot the residuals against the fitted response variable. . fitted = results.fittedvalues residuals = results.resid # Horizontal line on the x axis. plt.axhline(color = &quot;r&quot;, label = &quot;Fitted SAT Score&quot;) # Scatter plot. plt.scatter(fitted, residuals, label = &quot;Residual Error&quot;) plt.title(&quot;Residuals against Fitted SAT Score&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Fitted SAT Score&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Residual Error&quot;) plt.legend(loc = &quot;best&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . In this graph, we ideally want to see the points cluster uniformly around the red line, without any trends. . However, if we follow the outline of the general mass of points, these seem to follow a curve. However, the points on the right side are loosely scattered, so we cannot be sure whether there is truly a curve or it is merely due to outliers. . Anyway, we saw earlier that the Durbin-Watson test statistic was within the acceptable range, so the distribution of residuals is alright. We can move on to the next step. . Linearity . The next assumption that we will test is linearity. The predictors must be linearly correlated with the response variable; the relationship should not be too curved or abnormal. . We can test this visually by plotting the actual average SAT scores against the fitted scores which were predicted by our model. . fitted = results.fittedvalues # Scatter plot plt.scatter(fitted, y, label = &quot;Actual data&quot;) # Use OLS model results to get trend line. x_fitting = sm.add_constant(fitted) trend_model = sm.OLS(y, x_fitting) trend_results = trend_model.fit() trend_params = trend_results.params trend_const = trend_params[&quot;const&quot;] trend_coeff = trend_params[0] y_plot = trend_coeff * fitted + trend_const plt.plot(fitted, y_plot, color = &quot;r&quot;, label = &quot;Trend line&quot;) # Extra plot info plt.title(&quot;&quot;&quot;Actual SAT scores against Fitted SAT scores&quot;&quot;&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Fitted SAT Score&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Actual SAT Score&quot;) plt.legend(loc = &quot;best&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The trend line above fits the actual data quite well. Moreover, the actual data seems to follow a mostly linear shape. Thus, there is no cause for concern here. . Homoscedasticity . The last assumption that we will test is homoscedasticity. This means that the variance is consistent across all values of residuals. If this is not the case, the model has heteroscedasticity, which is problematic. . This can be tested using the Breusch-Pagan test. The null hypothesis is that heteroscedasticity is not present (which is ideal). A statistically significant p-value supports the claim that there is heteroscedasticity, in which case we would have to adjust the model. . b_labels = [&#39;Lagrange multiplier statistic&#39;, &#39;p-value&#39;, &#39;f-value&#39;, &#39;f p-value&#39;] b_test = sms.het_breuschpagan( residuals, model.exog, ) b_results = pd.DataFrame(zip(b_labels, b_test)) b_results.columns = [&quot;Information&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;] b_results . Information Value . 0 Lagrange multiplier statistic | 1.028960e+02 | . 1 p-value | 6.237518e-20 | . 2 f-value | 2.266603e+01 | . 3 f p-value | 5.711239e-23 | . Both p-values have a factor of around $10^{-20}$. In other words, these are very close to 0, which means that these are significant. Thus, the model is heteroscedastic. . We can make the results robust against heteroscedasticity by specifying an HCCM (Heteroscedasticity Consistent Covariance Matrix). We will specifically choose HC0. It doesn&#39;t perform well for sample sizes under 250 (Python for Data Science), but our sample size is 401, so we can use it. . model = sm.OLS(y, X) results = model.fit( cov_type = &#39;HC0&#39;, # Specify an HCCM. ) summary = results.summary() tables = extract_summary(summary) . Now that we&#39;ve tested all of the assumptions and adjusted for heteroscedasticity, we can move on to partial regression plots. . Partial regression plots . Partial regression plots) are used to visualize the relationship between 1 predictor and the response variable while holding all other predictors constant. . The plots are made below. . def par_reg_plot(data, label, show_dbn = False): &quot;&quot;&quot;Take a predictor label and plot its partial regression plot, which takes the other predictors into account. Note: This function references objects from the global namespace.&quot;&quot;&quot; title = &quot;Partial Regression Plot nSAT Score against `{}`&quot;.format(label) x_label = &quot;`{}` nPartial Residuals&quot;.format(label) # List of all IVs other than the current one. others = [col for col in iv_list if col != label] fig = sm.graphics.plot_partregress( endog = &quot;R_sat_score&quot;, exog_i = label, exog_others = others, data = data, obs_labels = show_dbn, ) plt.title(title) plt.xlabel(x_label) plt.ylabel(&quot;SAT Score nPartial Residuals&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.legend( labels = [&quot;Actual partial residuals&quot;, &quot;Trend line&quot;], loc = &quot;best&quot;, ) plt.tight_layout( h_pad = 2, ) plt.show() for label in iv_list: par_reg_plot(regression_data, label) . We can observe that: . English Language Learner percentage and Special Education percentage fit the linear trend best. | Female percentage residuals all cluster around one spot and don&#39;t follow a trend. | The other variables, which involve race percentages, seem to be affected by outliers. | . We should keep these plots in mind as we interpret the model results since these don&#39;t show whether outliers may have led to an overestimation of the significance of a predictor. . Interpretation of Results . Below is the first table of model results. . tables[0] . 0 1 2 3 . 0 Dep. Variable: | R_sat_score | R-squared: | 7.860000e-01 | . 1 Model: | OLS | Adj.

Multiple regression analysis was used to test if a school&#39;s percentages of English Language Learners, Special Education students, female students Asian students, black students, and white students significantly predicted the school&#39;s average total SAT score. . The six predictors explained 78.6% of the variance (R2= 0.786, F(6, 394) = 96.44, p &lt; 0.01). . Next is the second table of results, which shows the beta coefficient, p-value, etc. for each predictor variable. . tables[1] . coef std err z P&gt;|z| [0.025 0.975] VIF . label . const 1430.1978 | 32.665 | 43.784 | 0.00 | 1366.175 | 1494.220 | NaN | .

D_black_per -1.3553 | 0.182 | -7.446 | 0.00 | -1.712 | -0.999 | 3.926733 | . D_white_per 3.8196 | 0.604 | 6.329 | 0.00 | 2.637 | 5.002 | 1.777499 | . The predicted average SAT score in a school is approximately equal to 1430 - 5.22(ELL percentage) - 8.68(SpEd percentage) - 0.81(female percentage) + 3.60(Asian percentage) - 1.36(black percentage) + 3.82(white percentage). . All of the independent variables used in the model were significant predictors of the school&#39;s average SAT score, with p &lt; 0.05. However, since the female percentage variable&#39;s VIF value was greater than 5, strong multicollinearity was present, so its significance value may not be reliably interpreted. . The coefficients for ELL percentage, SpEd percentage, and black student percentage were negative. This means that these factors are associated with lower average SAT score in an NYC high school. . On the other hand, the coefficients for Asian percentage and white percentage were positive. This means that these factors are associated with higher average SAT score in an NYC high school. However, the linear relationship in the partial regression plots appeared to be affected by outliers, so the effect of these variables may not be strong for the majority of high schools. . In general, however, these results present initial evidence that race percentages in an NYC high school may significantly affect its average SAT score. . Conclusion . In this project, we cleaned, transformed, and combined multiple datasets about New York City high schools. We then conducted exploratory data analysis using Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficients and bivariate scatterplots. . Then, multiple linear regression was performed. The model explained 78.6% of the variance (R2= 0.786, F(6, 394) = 96.44, p &lt; 0.01). This supports the claim that the percentage of each race in a school has an effect on the school&#39;s average SAT score. . Thanks for reading! .",

Note: I wrote this notebook for the Dataquest course&#8217;s Guided Project: Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys. The general project flow and research questions came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. . Package Installs . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns .

ID contains integers, whereas all other columns either contain text or booleans. Also, many of the columns have missing values. . There are 822 rows (employees) and 56 columns (survey questions). Dataquest describes a few notable columns as follows: . &quot;ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey&quot; | &quot;SeparationType: The reason why the person&#39;s employment ended&quot; | &quot;Cease Date: The year or month the person&#39;s employment ended&quot; | &quot;DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE&quot; | . Also, if we look closely, we can see that many of the columns in the DETE dataset match columns in the TAFE dataset. For example: . print(&quot;TAFE Columns&quot;) print(list(tafe.columns[5:17])) print(&quot; nDETE Columns&quot;) print(list(dete.columns[10:28])) . TAFE Columns [&#39;Contributing Factors.

The Cease Date, DETE Start Date, and Role Start Date columns are interesting because these are in text format and some of the values are &quot;Not Stated&quot;. . Also, based on counts of non-null values shown earlier, some columns have many missing values. These will have to be addressed in data cleaning. . Data Cleaning . Placeholders for Missing Values . Earlier, we noticed that some columns in the DETE data contain &quot;Not Stated&quot; values. These are likely to be placeholders for missing data. . Therefore, we can replace all &quot;Not Stated&quot; values with np.nan null values. . dete = dete.replace(&quot;Not Stated&quot;, np.nan) . Dropping Columns . In the TAFE dataset, there are 4 other big groups of columns other than Contributing Factors: . Institute Views | Work Unit Views | Induction Info | Workplace | . We want to remove these columns in order to limit the columns in our dataset to the most relevant ones. This is done below. . tafe = tafe.drop( labels = tafe.columns[17:66], axis = 1, ) list(tafe.columns) . [&#39;Record ID&#39;, &#39;Institute&#39;, &#39;WorkArea&#39;, &#39;CESSATION YEAR&#39;, &#39;Reason for ceasing employment&#39;, &#39;Contributing Factors.

Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)&#39;, &#39;LengthofServiceCurrent. Length of Service at current workplace (in years)&#39;] . There are now only 23 columns in the TAFE dataset. . Earlier, in the Data Overview, we mentioned that DETE has similar columns to the ones in TAFE. For example, look at the columns from indices 28 to 48: . dete.columns[28:49] . Index([&#39;Professional Development&#39;, &#39;Opportunities for promotion&#39;, &#39;Staff morale&#39;, &#39;Workplace issue&#39;, &#39;Physical environment&#39;, &#39;Worklife balance&#39;, &#39;Stress and pressure support&#39;, &#39;Performance of supervisor&#39;, &#39;Peer support&#39;, &#39;Initiative&#39;, &#39;Skills&#39;, &#39;Coach&#39;, &#39;Career Aspirations&#39;, &#39;Feedback&#39;, &#39;Further PD&#39;, &#39;Communication&#39;, &#39;My say&#39;, &#39;Information&#39;, &#39;Kept informed&#39;, &#39;Wellness programs&#39;, &#39;Health &amp; Safety&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) . These are equivalent to the TAFE columns under the Institute Views, Work Unit Views, Induction Info, and Workspace groups. We don&#39;t need these groups since the Contributing Factors group is directly related to the reason why the employees resigned. . Thus, we will remove the columns shown above from the DETE dataset. . dete = dete.drop( dete.columns[28:49], axis = 1, ) len(dete.columns) . 35 . Matching Columns in TAFE and DETE . Below are some important columns in TAFE and DETE which have matching information. . DETE Survey TAFE Survey . ID | Record ID | . SeparationType | Reason for ceasing employment | . Cease Date | CESSATION YEAR | . DETE Start Date | LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years) | . Age | CurrentAge. Current Age | . Gender | Gender. What is your Gender? | . Notably, DETE Start Date and LengthofServiceOverall are matching columns because one can tell how long the employee has been working based on the date when they first started working. . We want to make the column names the same between the two datasets. . Before we do that, we will simplify the names in DETE. . dete.columns = ( dete.columns .str.lower() # All lowercase .str.strip() # Remove whitespace on sides .str.replace(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;) # Replace spaces with underscores ) dete.columns . Index([&#39;id&#39;, &#39;separationtype&#39;, &#39;cease_date&#39;, &#39;dete_start_date&#39;, &#39;role_start_date&#39;, &#39;position&#39;, &#39;classification&#39;, &#39;region&#39;, &#39;business_unit&#39;, &#39;employment_status&#39;, &#39;career_move_to_public_sector&#39;, &#39;career_move_to_private_sector&#39;, &#39;interpersonal_conflicts&#39;, &#39;job_dissatisfaction&#39;, &#39;dissatisfaction_with_the_department&#39;, &#39;physical_work_environment&#39;, &#39;lack_of_recognition&#39;, &#39;lack_of_job_security&#39;, &#39;work_location&#39;, &#39;employment_conditions&#39;, &#39;maternity/family&#39;, &#39;relocation&#39;, &#39;study/travel&#39;, &#39;ill_health&#39;, &#39;traumatic_incident&#39;, &#39;work_life_balance&#39;, &#39;workload&#39;, &#39;none_of_the_above&#39;, &#39;gender&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;aboriginal&#39;, &#39;torres_strait&#39;, &#39;south_sea&#39;, &#39;disability&#39;, &#39;nesb&#39;], dtype=&#39;object&#39;) . The DETE columns have been simplified. . Next, we will change some of the TAFE column labels to match the ones in the DETE dataset. . new_columns = { &#39;Record ID&#39;: &#39;id&#39;, &#39;CESSATION YEAR&#39;: &#39;cease_date&#39;, &#39;Reason for ceasing employment&#39;: &#39;separationtype&#39;, &#39;Gender.

The Contributing Factors columns&#39; names haven&#39;t been changed yet, but this will be dealt with later. . Identifying Employees who Resigned . The DETE and TAFE exit surveys were given to all employees who left the institutions. Some of them were terminated from employment, some resigned, and some retired. . The goal of this project is to find out why employees resigned. Thus, we have to find out who resigned, and drop the data for the rest. . Let&#39;s do this for the DETE dataset first. The separationtype column explains the reason why the employee ceased to work at the institution. What values does this column contain? . dete[&quot;separationtype&quot;].value_counts() . Age Retirement 285 Resignation-Other reasons 150 Resignation-Other employer 91 Resignation-Move overseas/interstate 70 Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) 67 Ill Health Retirement 61 Other 49 Contract Expired 34 Termination 15 Name: separationtype, dtype: int64 . It looks like the values that are relevant to us are the ones that start with &quot;Resignation.&quot; We&#39;ll keep the rows which indicate resignation and drop the rest. . dete = dete.loc[ # Check if the string starts with &quot;Resignation.&quot; dete[&quot;separationtype&quot;].str.startswith(&quot;Resignation&quot;) ] dete.shape . (311, 35) . After we dropped non-resignation rows, the DETE dataset was left with 311 rows. . Next, we&#39;ll do the same for the TAFE dataset. What are the values in its separationtype column? . tafe[&quot;separationtype&quot;].value_counts() . Resignation 340 Contract Expired 127 Retrenchment/ Redundancy 104 Retirement 82 Transfer 25 Termination 23 Name: separationtype, dtype: int64 . This time, there is only one value which indicates resignation. We&#39;ll use that to identify the rows to keep. . tafe = tafe.loc[ # Check if the value is &quot;Resignation.&quot; tafe[&quot;separationtype&quot;] == &quot;Resignation&quot; ] tafe.shape . (340, 23) . Dropping rows resulted in having 340 rows left in the TAFE dataset. . Now, both datasets have been narrowed down to data about employees who intentionally left the institutions. . Date Columns . Next, we&#39;ll clean and inspect date columns. Specifically, these are: . DETE dataset dete_start_date: The date when the employee started to work at DETE. | cease_date: The date when the employee ceased to work at DETE. | . | TAFE dataset cease_date: The date when the employee ceased to work at TAFE. | . | . Let&#39;s start with DETE&#39;s cease_date. What are its values? . dete[&quot;cease_date&quot;].value_counts() . 2012 126 2013 74 01/2014 22 12/2013 17 06/2013 14 09/2013 11 07/2013 9 11/2013 9 10/2013 6 08/2013 4 05/2013 2 05/2012 2 07/2006 1 2010 1 09/2010 1 07/2012 1 Name: cease_date, dtype: int64 . We can see that some values only contain years, and others state a month before the year. Since we can&#39;t assume the month for entries without one, we will remove all of the months. Only the years will remain, and we will store them as numerical data. . dete[&quot;cease_date&quot;] = ( dete[&quot;cease_date&quot;] .str.extract(&quot;(20[0-1][0-9])&quot;) # Extract year using a regular expression .astype(np.float64) # Turn years into decimals ) dete[&quot;cease_date&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 2006.0 1 2010.0 2 2012.0 129 2013.0 146 2014.0 22 Name: cease_date, dtype: int64 . The DETE cease_date column now only contains year values. These range from 2006 to 2014. . Next, let&#39;s look at DETE&#39;s dete_start_date column. . dete[&quot;dete_start_date&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 1963 1 1971 1 1972 1 1973 1 1974 2 1975 1 1976 2 1977 1 1980 5 1982 1 1983 2 1984 1 1985 3 1986 3 1987 1 1988 4 1989 4 1990 5 1991 4 1992 6 1993 5 1994 6 1995 4 1996 6 1997 5 1998 6 1999 8 2000 9 2001 3 2002 6 2003 6 2004 14 2005 15 2006 13 2007 21 2008 22 2009 13 2010 17 2011 24 2012 21 2013 10 Name: dete_start_date, dtype: int64 . The column contains only years, no months, so it is quite clean. Most of the values are from 2004 to 2013. The years in the late 1900&#39;s don&#39;t seem like outliers because there are many values spread throughout those years. . It also makes sense that there are no dete_start_date values after 2014, since the latest cease_date is 2014. . There&#39;s no need to clean this column, but let&#39;s convert it to numerical data for consistency. . dete[&quot;dete_start_date&quot;] = dete[&quot;dete_start_date&quot;].astype(np.float64) . Lastly, let&#39;s look at the TAFE dataset&#39;s cease_date column. . tafe[&quot;cease_date&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 2009.0 2 2010.0 68 2011.0 116 2012.0 94 2013.0 55 Name: cease_date, dtype: int64 . The data here looks like it&#39;s already clean. The years are expressed as decimals, and there are no outliers to clean up. This column won&#39;t be changed. . The TAFE cease_date years range from 2009 to 2013. DETE&#39;s cease_date values range from 2006 to 2014. Therefore, both datasets give information about roughly the same period in time. . Years of Service . Remember that one of the goals of the project is to compare dissatisfaction rates between resignees who had worked for a short time and those who had worked for a longer time. Thus, we need to know how many years of service each employee has had. . The TAFE dataset already has a column called institute_service which gives information on this. . tafe[&quot;institute_service&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 1-2 64 11-20 26 3-4 63 5-6 33 7-10 21 Less than 1 year 73 More than 20 years 10 Name: institute_service, dtype: int64 . These values are somewhat difficult to use since these indicate ranges of years of service. This will be dealt with later, but for now, we have to make a matching column in the DETE dataset. . In order to do this, we will subtract dete_start_date from cease_date. This will result in the number of years that each employee has spent working at DETE. The new column will be called institute_service like in the TAFE dataset. . dete[&quot;institute_service&quot;] = dete[&quot;cease_date&quot;] - dete[&quot;dete_start_date&quot;] dete[&quot;institute_service&quot;].value_counts(bins = 10) . (-0.05, 4.9] 92 (4.9, 9.8] 75 (9.8, 14.7] 30 (14.7, 19.6] 26 (19.6, 24.5] 24 (24.5, 29.4] 8 (29.4, 34.3] 8 (34.3, 39.2] 7 (39.2, 44.1] 2 (44.1, 49.0] 1 Name: institute_service, dtype: int64 . It can be seen that DETE employees&#39; years of service range from under 4.9 to over 44.1. Let&#39;s view the distribution in a histogram. . sns.histplot( data = dete, x = &quot;institute_service&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;DETE Employees&#39; Years of Service&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Years of Service&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The distribution is right-skewed. Most employees who resigned had worked at DETE for under 10 years. . &quot;Contributing Factors&quot; Columns . The Contributing Factors columns are about factors which may have influenced the employee&#39;s choice to resign. In the TAFE dataset, these columns have hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) values. This leads us to wonder what they represent, and whether or not we have to clean them. . Let&#39;s look at column 5, one of the columns with hyphens. . tafe.iloc[:, 5].value_counts(dropna = False) . - 284 Career Move - Public Sector 48 NaN 8 Name: Contributing Factors. Career Move - Public Sector , dtype: int64 . Most of the values are hyphens. The rest are null values or &quot;Career Move - Public Sector&quot;. . We can infer that the Contributing Factors group of columns represent options in a checkbox item in the survey. That&#39;s why each column only has 2 valid values: . &quot;-&quot; means that the option was not selected. | &quot;Career Move - Public Sector&quot; means that the option was selected. | . Thus, we can change the values in column 5 into True (selected) and False (not selected) for ease of use. . def identify_selection(value): if pd.isnull(value): return np.nan else: return value != &quot;-&quot; # Apply the function elementwise. tafe.iloc[:, 5] = tafe.iloc[:, 5].apply(identify_selection) tafe.iloc[:, 5].value_counts(dropna = False) . False 284 True 48 NaN 8 Name: Contributing Factors. Career Move - Public Sector , dtype: int64 . Now, the column only has True, False, and NaN values. . Let us apply this transformaton to the entire group of &quot;Contributing Factors&quot; columns (5 to 16). . tafe.iloc[:, 6:17] = tafe.iloc[:, 6:17].applymap(identify_selection) tafe.iloc[:, 5:17].head() . Contributing Factors. Career Move - Public Sector Contributing Factors. Career Move - Private Sector Contributing Factors. Career Move - Self-employment Contributing Factors. Ill Health Contributing Factors. Maternity/Family Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction Contributing Factors. Interpersonal Conflict Contributing Factors. Study Contributing Factors. Travel Contributing Factors. Other Contributing Factors. NONE . 3 False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | True | False | False | . 4 False | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | . 5 False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | True | False | . 6 False | True | False | False | True | False | False | False | False | False | True | False | . 7 False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | True | False | . Since these columns are now boolean columns, these will be easier to use in analysis. . It is worth noting that what we did matches the format used for Contributing Factors columns in DETE: . dete.iloc[:5, 10:28] . career_move_to_public_sector career_move_to_private_sector interpersonal_conflicts job_dissatisfaction dissatisfaction_with_the_department physical_work_environment lack_of_recognition lack_of_job_security work_location employment_conditions maternity/family relocation study/travel ill_health traumatic_incident work_life_balance workload none_of_the_above . 3 False | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | . 5 False | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | True | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | . 8 False | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | . 9 False | False | True | True | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | . 11 False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | False | True | True | False | False | False | False | False | False | . Thus, we will be able to use similar techniques to identify dissatisfaction in both datasets. . Identifying Dissatisfaction . This project focuses on employees who resigned due to dissatisfaction with their work at the government institute. Thus, we have to identify which employees were dissatisfied. . In the TAFE dataset, the following columns indicate dissatisfaction: . Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction | Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction | . We will create a new dissatisfaction column. It will be a boolean column that contains True if at least 1 of the above columns has a value of True. . tafe[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;] = ( tafe[[ &quot;Contributing Factors. Dissatisfaction&quot;, &quot;Contributing Factors. Job Dissatisfaction&quot;, ]] .any(axis = 1, skipna = False) ) tafe[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;].value_counts(dropna = False) . False 241 True 91 NaN 8 Name: dissatisfaction, dtype: int64 . It looks like 91 employees in the TAFE dataset resigned due to dissatisfaction. . As for the DETE dataset, there are many relevant columns. . job_dissatisfaction | dissatisfaction_with_the_department | physical_work_environment | lack_of_recognition | lack_of_job_security | work_location | employment_conditions | work_life_balance | workload | . Remember that in the survey, these phrases were options in a checkbox item asking why the employee left. A True value in any of these columns means that the employee considered it a reason why he/she resigned. . We will create a new dissatisfaction column in the DETE dataset in the same way as we did for the TAFE dataset. If at least 1 of the above columns is True, the corresponding value in the new column will be True. . dete[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;] = ( dete[[ &#39;job_dissatisfaction&#39;, &#39;dissatisfaction_with_the_department&#39;, &#39;physical_work_environment&#39;, &#39;lack_of_recognition&#39;, &#39;lack_of_job_security&#39;, &#39;work_location&#39;, &#39;employment_conditions&#39;, &#39;work_life_balance&#39;, &#39;workload&#39;, ]] .any(axis = 1, skipna = False) ) dete[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;].value_counts(dropna = False) . False 162 True 149 Name: dissatisfaction, dtype: int64 . The results show that 149 of DETE employees who resigned had been dissatisfied. . Combining DETE and TAFE . At this point, the data cleaning we&#39;ve done is sufficient for us to combine the two datasets. We will stack them vertically; they will share columns with identical names. . We will still need to be able to differentiate between DETE and TAFE employees, so we will indicate this in a new column. . In the DETE dataset, the new institute column will contain the string &quot;DETE&quot;. . dete[&quot;institute&quot;] = &quot;DETE&quot; dete[&quot;institute&quot;].head() . 3 DETE 5 DETE 8 DETE 9 DETE 11 DETE Name: institute, dtype: object . The value in the TAFE dataset will be &quot;TAFE&quot;. . tafe[&quot;institute&quot;] = &quot;TAFE&quot; tafe[&quot;institute&quot;].head() . 3 TAFE 4 TAFE 5 TAFE 6 TAFE 7 TAFE Name: institute, dtype: object .

The combined dataset has 651 rows (employees) and 53 columns. . Given our research questions, the most important columns to keep are institute_service, age, and dissatisfaction. We would only keep the other columns if we wanted to group the employees on certain characteristics. . Thus, we will remove columns that have under 500 non-null values. These columns wouldn&#39;t have enough useful information for us to use. . combined.dropna( axis = 1, thresh = 500, inplace = True, ) print(combined.shape) combined.head() .

Only 10 columns were left in the dataset. The 3 most important columns were kept, along with a few columns about useful demographic data. . Cleaning Age Data . One of the goals of this project involves the age data. Thus, we need to ensure that this data is clean. . Let us view the unique values in the column. . combined[&quot;age&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 20 or younger 10 21 25 33 21-25 29 26 30 32 26-30 35 31 35 32 31-35 29 36 40 32 36-40 41 41 45 45 41-45 48 46 50 39 46-50 42 51-55 71 56 or older 29 56-60 26 61 or older 23 Name: age, dtype: int64 . We can see that: . All values represent a range of ages. | Some have hyphens, and others have spaces. | A few are phrases that say &quot;or younger&quot; or &quot;or older.&quot; | . Therefore, we will clean the data by defining the following function and applying it elementwise to the column: . def fix_age(text): if pd.isnull(text): result = np.nan elif &quot; &quot; in text: result = text.replace(&quot; &quot;, &quot;-&quot;) elif text in [&quot;56-60&quot;, &quot;61 or older&quot;]: result = &quot;56 or older&quot; else: result = text return result combined[&quot;age&quot;] = combined[&quot;age&quot;].apply(fix_age) combined[&quot;age&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 20 or younger 10 21-25 62 26-30 67 31-35 61 36-40 73 41-45 93 46-50 81 51-55 71 56 or older 78 Name: age, dtype: int64 . Now, the values in the age column are consistent. . Categorizing Years of Service . Remember that DETE and TAFE differed in the format of their institute_service columns: . DETE had decimal numbers representing the number of years. | TAFE had strings, each of which represented a range of years. | . We could take the TAFE ranges and replace them with the middle value of each range. However, this would make the data inaccurate. . Instead, we will transform the data to become more general. We&#39;ll group the data into categories which represent ranges of years. This will apply to the entire institute_service column in the combined dataset. . The article &quot;Age is Just a Number: Engage Employees by Career Stage, Too&quot; states that employee engagement can be better understood in the context of career stage, i.e., the number of years working at the company. Career stage influences an employee&#39;s work attitude and virtues that they value in the workplace. . We can also say that career stage influences employees&#39; decisions to resign. The most obvious example of this is that a new employee isn&#39;t very invested in the company and would be more likely to leave due to initial dissatisfaction. . The article gives the following 4 career stages: . Newbie (0 to 3 years) | Sophomore (3 to 7 years) | Tenured (7 to 11 years) | Sage (11 or more years) | . We will use the above career stages as categories in the institute_service column. But first, we have to be prepared for what kinds of values we will have to transform. . combined[&quot;institute_service&quot;].unique() . array([7.0, 18.0, 3.0, 15.0, 14.0, 5.0, nan, 30.0, 32.0, 39.0, 17.0, 9.0, 6.0, 1.0, 35.0, 38.0, 36.0, 19.0, 4.0, 26.0, 10.0, 8.0, 2.0, 0.0, 23.0, 13.0, 16.0, 12.0, 21.0, 20.0, 24.0, 33.0, 22.0, 28.0, 49.0, 11.0, 41.0, 27.0, 42.0, 25.0, 29.0, 34.0, 31.0, &#39;3-4&#39;, &#39;7-10&#39;, &#39;1-2&#39;, &#39;Less than 1 year&#39;, &#39;11-20&#39;, &#39;5-6&#39;, &#39;More than 20 years&#39;], dtype=object) . The values above include: . Decimal numbers | A range of years (&quot;x-y&quot;) | A phrase describing a range of years (&quot;Less than x years&quot;) | . Extracting Numbers . Based on the values present, we will extract the number of years using the regular expression ([0-9]{1,2}). This will capture the first 1 or 2 digit whole number in a string. . For decimals, the part of the number before the decimal point will be extracted. | For ranges of years, the minimum year will be extracted. | For phrases, the first number to appear will be extracted. | . combined[&quot;service_num&quot;] = ( combined[&quot;institute_service&quot;] .astype(str) # Convert to strings. .str.extract(&quot;([0-9]{1,2})&quot;) # Extract 1 or 2-digit number. .astype(np.float64) # Convert to decimals. ) combined[&quot;service_num&quot;].unique() . array([ 7., 18., 3., 15., 14., 5., nan, 30., 32., 39., 17., 9., 6., 1., 35., 38., 36., 19., 4., 26., 10., 8., 2., 0., 23., 13., 16., 12., 21., 20., 24., 33., 22., 28., 49., 11., 41., 27., 42., 25., 29., 34., 31.]) . This worked for the decimals, as seen below. The initial and final values are identical. . combined.loc[ combined[&quot;institute_service&quot;].astype(str).str.contains(&quot;.&quot;), [&quot;institute_service&quot;, &quot;service_num&quot;] ].head() . institute_service service_num . 0 7.0 | 7.0 | . 1 18.0 | 18.0 | . 2 3.0 | 3.0 | . 3 15.0 | 15.0 | . 4 3.0 | 3.0 | . We can tell that this worked for the ranges because the minimum value was extracted. For example, for &quot;3-4&quot;, the number 3 was extracted. . combined.loc[ combined[&quot;institute_service&quot;].astype(str).str.contains(&quot;-&quot;), [&quot;institute_service&quot;, &quot;service_num&quot;] ].head() . institute_service service_num . 312 3-4 | 3.0 | . 313 7-10 | 7.0 | . 314 3-4 | 3.0 | . 315 3-4 | 3.0 | . 316 3-4 | 3.0 | . It also worked for the phrases, as seen below. The number in the phrase was extracted. . combined.loc[ combined[&quot;institute_service&quot;].astype(str).str.contains(&quot;than&quot;), [&quot;institute_service&quot;, &quot;service_num&quot;] ].head() . institute_service service_num . 318 Less than 1 year | 1.0 | . 329 Less than 1 year | 1.0 | . 332 More than 20 years | 20.0 | . 333 Less than 1 year | 1.0 | . 334 Less than 1 year | 1.0 | . Mapping Numbers to Categories . Now that we have numbers, we can map them to the career stages mentioned earlier: . Newbie (0 to 3 years) | Sophomore (3 to 7 years) | Tenured (7 to 11 years) | Sage (11 or more years) | . We&#39;ll do this by defining a function then applying it elementwise to the column. . def career_stage(years): if pd.isnull(years): stage = np.nan elif years &lt; 3.0: stage = &quot;Newbie&quot; elif years &lt; 7.0: stage = &quot;Sophomore&quot; elif years &lt; 11.0: stage = &quot;Tenured&quot; elif years &gt;= 11.0: stage = &quot;Sage&quot; return stage # Apply the function elementwise and make a new column. combined[&quot;service_cat&quot;] = combined[&quot;service_num&quot;].apply(career_stage) combined[&quot;service_cat&quot;].value_counts() . Newbie 193 Sophomore 172 Sage 136 Tenured 62 Name: service_cat, dtype: int64 . The results show that most of the employees who resigned were Newbies. . Data cleaning is now complete, so we can go to data analysis. . Data Analysis . Dissatisfaction by Age Group . First, we can investigate the dissatisfaction rates of resignees by their age group. . df = combined.dropna(subset = [&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;, &quot;age&quot;]).copy() # Cast booleans to integers. df[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;] = df[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;].astype(int) table_3 = df.pivot_table( values = [&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;], index = [&quot;age&quot;], aggfunc = np.mean, # Mean will determine the percentage of True values. True is 1; False is 0. ).reset_index() table_3 . age dissatisfaction . 0 20 or younger | 0.200000 | . 1 21-25 | 0.306452 | . 2 26-30 | 0.417910 | . 3 31-35 | 0.377049 | . 4 36-40 | 0.342466 | . 5 41-45 | 0.376344 | . 6 46-50 | 0.382716 | . 7 51-55 | 0.422535 | . 8 56 or older | 0.423077 | . This table is visualized in the bar graph below. . sns.barplot( data = table_3, x = &quot;age&quot;, y = &quot;dissatisfaction&quot;, estimator = np.mean, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Dissatisfaction Rates of Resignees by Age Group&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Age Group&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Percentage of Resignees who were Dissatisfied&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 30, ha = &quot;right&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Notably, the dissatisfaction rate is: . Lowest (20%) among resignees aged 20 or younger. | Above 30% among resignees aged 21 or older. | Highest (42%) among resignees aged 56 or older, 51-55, or 26-30. | . Let&#39;s group the data further using the institute (DETE or TAFE). . table_4 = df.pivot_table( values = [&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;], index = [&quot;age&quot;, &quot;institute&quot;], aggfunc = np.mean, # Mean will determine the percentage of True values. True is 1; False is 0. ).reset_index() table_4 . age institute dissatisfaction . 0 20 or younger | DETE | 0.000000 | . 1 20 or younger | TAFE | 0.222222 | . 2 21-25 | DETE | 0.310345 | . 3 21-25 | TAFE | 0.303030 | . 4 26-30 | DETE | 0.571429 | . 5 26-30 | TAFE | 0.250000 | . 6 31-35 | DETE | 0.551724 | . 7 31-35 | TAFE | 0.218750 | . 8 36-40 | DETE | 0.390244 | . 9 36-40 | TAFE | 0.281250 | . 10 41-45 | DETE | 0.479167 | . 11 41-45 | TAFE | 0.266667 | . 12 46-50 | DETE | 0.452381 | . 13 46-50 | TAFE | 0.307692 | . 14 51-55 | DETE | 0.593750 | . 15 51-55 | TAFE | 0.282051 | . 16 56 or older | DETE | 0.551020 | . 17 56 or older | TAFE | 0.206897 | . The table is visualized in the bar graph below. . sns.barplot( data = table_4, x = &quot;age&quot;, y = &quot;dissatisfaction&quot;, hue = &quot;institute&quot;, estimator = np.mean, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Dissatisfaction Rates of Resignees by Age Group&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Age Group&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Percentage of Resignees who were Dissatisfied&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 30, ha = &quot;right&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . We can see that employees of DETE generally had much higher dissatisfaction rates than employees of TAFE across all age groups. . The exception is the &quot;20 or younger&quot; age group, which has a 0% dissatisfaction rate for DETE employees. However, this is due to the fact that only one resignee from DETE was 20 years old or younger. . ( combined .loc[combined[&quot;institute&quot;] == &quot;DETE&quot;, &quot;age&quot;] .value_counts() .sort_index() ) . 20 or younger 1 21-25 29 26-30 35 31-35 29 36-40 41 41-45 48 46-50 42 51-55 32 56 or older 49 Name: age, dtype: int64 . Thus, we can generally say that the dissatisfaction rate was much higher among DETE resignees compared to TAFE resignees. . Also, the peak dissatisfaction rates occurred in age groups around 26-30 years old and 51-55 years old for both institutes. . Dissatisfaction by Career Stage . Next, we will determine what percentage of the resignees was dissatisfied with work based on career stage. . df = combined.dropna(subset = [&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;, &quot;service_cat&quot;]).copy() # Cast booleans to integers. df[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;] = df[&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;].astype(int) table_1 = df.pivot_table( values = [&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;], index = [&quot;service_cat&quot;], aggfunc = np.mean, # Mean will determine the percentage of True values. True is 1; False is 0. ).reset_index() table_1 . service_cat dissatisfaction . 0 Newbie | 0.295337 | . 1 Sage | 0.485294 | . 2 Sophomore | 0.343023 | . 3 Tenured | 0.516129 | . The table is visualized in the figure below. . sns.barplot( data = table_1, x = &quot;service_cat&quot;, y = &quot;dissatisfaction&quot;, estimator = np.mean, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Dissatisfaction Rates of Resignees by Career Stage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Career Stage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Percentage of Resignees who were Dissatisfied&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 0) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Interestingly, the dissatisfaction rate is highest (around 50%) within the Tenured and Sage groups of resignees. This is surprising since these are the groups of employees who have been working at the institute for the longest time. . One explanation could be that they became dissatisfied because they spent so much time at the company without career growth or without sufficient variety in their work. . Next, we can group the data further by the specific institute of the employees: . table_2 = df.pivot_table( values = [&quot;dissatisfaction&quot;], index = [&quot;service_cat&quot;, &quot;institute&quot;], # Group on institute too aggfunc = np.mean, ).reset_index() table_2 . service_cat institute dissatisfaction . 0 Newbie | DETE | 0.375000 | . 1 Newbie | TAFE | 0.262774 | . 2 Sage | DETE | 0.560000 | . 3 Sage | TAFE | 0.277778 | . 4 Sophomore | DETE | 0.460526 | . 5 Sophomore | TAFE | 0.250000 | . 6 Tenured | DETE | 0.609756 | . 7 Tenured | TAFE | 0.333333 | . This table is visualized below. . sns.barplot( data = table_2, x = &quot;service_cat&quot;, y = &quot;dissatisfaction&quot;, hue = &quot;institute&quot;, estimator = np.mean, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Dissatisfaction Rates of Resignees by Career Stage&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Career Stage&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Percentage of Resignees who were Dissatisfied&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 0) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The chart shows that the trend is generally consistent between DETE and TAFE. Tenured and Sage resignees have a higher dissatisfaction rate than other groups. . However, it looks like the dissatisfaction rates in DETE are also much higher than the rates in TAFE. It can be said that dissatisfaction influences the resignation of a greater percentage of people in DETE than it does in TAFE. . Conclusion . In this project, we worked with 2 datasets of employee exit survey data from the DETE and TAFE government institutes in Australia. We cleaned, transformed, and combined these datasets. Then, we analyzed dissatisfaction rates of resignees based on age and based on career stage. . We found the following notable points: . Dissatisfaction rate was highest among resignees in age groups around 26-30 years old and 51-55 years old for both institutes. | Dissatisfaction rate was highest among resignees who had been working at the institute for over 7 years. | The dissatisfaction rate was much higher among DETE resignees compared to TAFE resignees. This may have to do with the nature or conditions of the work of DETE employees. | . Thanks for reading! .",

Thus, we want to make a chart with the following characteristics: . Eye-catching | Visually pleasing | Easy to understand | Has a clear main point, as opposed to being too detailed | . Put simply, it is similar to an infographic. However, instead of being a standalone image, it is usually put in an article with accompanying text. . In this project, I detail the process of designing an explanatory chart of USD-PHP exchange rates. I used the &quot;Forex data since 2011-1-1&quot; dataset, which was uploaded by user emrecanaltinsoy on Kaggle. By the end of the project, I was able to make the following chart. . . . Tip: The larger implications of exchange rate trends are beyond the scope of this project. For Filipinos, I suggest reading &quot;[ANALYSIS] Why the stronger peso mirrors a weaker PH economy&quot; (Punongbayan 2020), which is an interesting recent article. . .

Descriptive Statistics . Before we can clean the data, we have to view its descriptive statistics. . php.describe(datetime_is_numeric = True) . date usd_php . count 3798 | 3798.000000 | . mean 2016-03-13 12:00:00 | 47.010148 | . min 2011-01-01 00:00:00 | 3.094050 | . 25% 2013-08-07 06:00:00 | 43.639330 | . 50% 2016-03-13 12:00:00 | 46.890740 | . 75% 2018-10-18 18:00:00 | 50.584238 | . max 2021-05-25 00:00:00 | 54.323583 | . std NaN | 3.920411 | . As expected, the dates range from November 1, 2011 to May 25, 2021. . However, the minimum USD-PHP exchange rate in the data is 3.09. This is very low compared to the other percentiles. . Exchange Rate Outliers . There may be some outliers in the data. We can confirm this using a boxplot. . sns.boxplot( data = php, y = &quot;usd_php&quot; ) plt.title(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate Distribution&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Indeed, most of the values fall between 40 and 55, whereas a few outliers exist below 10. These may be inaccurate data. . How many outliers are there? . (php[&quot;usd_php&quot;] .value_counts(bins = 10) .sort_index() ) . (3.0420000000000003, 8.217] 2 (8.217, 13.34] 0 (13.34, 18.463] 0 (18.463, 23.586] 0 (23.586, 28.709] 0 (28.709, 33.832] 0 (33.832, 38.955] 0 (38.955, 44.078] 1157 (44.078, 49.201] 1289 (49.201, 54.324] 1350 Name: usd_php, dtype: int64 . There are only 2 values less than 10. It is highly unlikely that these values are accurate. This can be shown using a line chart. . sns.lineplot( data = php, x = &quot;date&quot;, y = &quot;usd_php&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate Over Time&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Time&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The outliers exist somewhere in the 2014 data, and they create an unnatural dip in the chart. . Thus, the inaccurate datapoints will be dropped from the dataset. . php = php.loc[php[&quot;usd_php&quot;] &gt; 10] php.describe(datetime_is_numeric = True) . date usd_php . count 3796 | 3796.000000 | . mean 2016-03-13 22:32:45.015806208 | 47.033285 | . min 2011-01-01 00:00:00 | 40.500000 | . 25% 2013-08-06 18:00:00 | 43.639981 | . 50% 2016-03-14 12:00:00 | 46.892504 | . 75% 2018-10-19 06:00:00 | 50.584680 | . max 2021-05-25 00:00:00 | 54.323583 | . std NaN | 3.789566 | . The minimum USD-PHP rate is now 40.5, which makes more sense. . Exploratory Data Analysis . Basic Line Chart . First, we start with a basic line chart that shows the exchange rates on all days in the dataset. . sns.lineplot( data = php, x = &quot;date&quot;, y = &quot;usd_php&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate Over Time&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Time&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The chart shows that the exchange rate dropped to under 41.0 in 2013. It then steadily climbed up to over 54.0 in 2018 before moving down again afterwards. . For Filipinos, it is ideal for the USD-PHP rate to be lower so that the peso has more power. Thus, it can be said that the exchange rate was better from 2011 to 2015 compared to how it has been in recent years. However, note that the USD-PHP exchange rate is not the only descriptor of the Philippines&#39; economy. . Rolling Average . In order to focus more on general trends than small fluctuations, we can graph the rolling average (or moving average). The rolling average is taken by replacing each datapoint with the mean average of a certain number of the datapoints leading up to it. . Using a rolling average can make a graph look visually cleaner and make general trends easier to see. . The number of datapoints used in each average is called the rolling window. This can be specified in Pandas using pd.Series.rolling(). Below, we use a rolling window of 182 days (around half a year) in order to transform the rate data. . php[&quot;rolling&quot;] = php[&quot;usd_php&quot;].rolling(182).mean() php.tail() . date usd_php rolling . 3793 2021-05-21 | 47.919983 | 48.237840 | . 3794 2021-05-22 | 47.929517 | 48.236031 | . 3795 2021-05-23 | 47.929517 | 48.234226 | . 3796 2021-05-24 | 48.068599 | 48.232923 | . 3797 2021-05-25 | 48.155798 | 48.232809 | . The last 5 rows of the dataset are shown above. The rolling averages are not exactly equal to the original numbers, but these are close enough to show the same trend. . A line chart of the rolling averages is shown below. . sns.lineplot( data = php, x = &quot;date&quot;, y = &quot;rolling&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate Over Time: Rolling Average&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Time&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;USD-PHP Exchange Rate&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The same trends mentioned earlier are clearer to see in the above chart. . Explanatory Chart . One idea of a useful chart would be to compare the USD-PHP exchange rate trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. . Note: A similar idea was suggested in the Dataquest guided project. However, I did not look at Dataquest&#8217;s solution notebook. I wrote my code on my own. . Key Concepts . The following concepts will be used throughout the process of designing the chart. I learned these from Dataquest&#39;s &quot;Data Scientist in Python&quot; course. . Familiarity . Audiences prefer familiar charts since they can understand these easily. Therefore, it is better to use a basic chart as a template than to use something obscure or create something entirely new. . In the case of showing USD-PHP exchange rates over time, it is best to use a basic line chart as a template. . Data-Ink Ratio . When making an explanatory chart, one must maximize the data-ink ratio. . Data refers to the elements that represent data and its relationships, like bars and lines. | Ink refers to the total amount of ink that the chart would use if it were printed on paper. | . Maximizing the data-ink ratio means focusing more on data-related elements and minimizing the use of other, less important elements. . This helps the audience understand the main point without being distracted by other details. . Gestalt Psychology . Gestalt psychology is founded on the idea that people tend to see patterns rather than individual objects. . Under Gestalt psychology, there are several Principles of Grouping. These are ways to visually group elements together. . Proximity: Elements are close to each other | Similarity: Elements are similar due to color, shape, etc. | Enclosure: Elements are enclosed in an outer shape, like a rectangle | Connection: Elements are connected by a form, usually a line | . When designing charts, these are helpful in implying relationships between elements instead of explicitly stating them. . Visual Style . Before we start making the chart, we have to choose a style. . I chose Matplotlib&#39;s built-in &quot;fivethirtyeight&quot; style. It&#39;s based on the style of the charts used on the FiveThirtyEight website by Nate Silver. . Additionally, I used color-hex.com to get hex codes for specific kinds of blue, orange, and dark gray that I want to use in my chart. . style.use(&quot;fivethirtyeight&quot;) # Color hex codes c_blue = &quot;#14c4dd&quot; c_orange = &quot;#ffa500&quot; c_dark_gray = &quot;#d2d2d2&quot; . Setting up Subplots . In order to make the chart fresh and interesting, we have to make it more complex than 1 plot with a line chart. In our case, I have the following ideas: . Show 2 line charts, one on top of the other. | The upper chart shows how the rate changed from 2011 to 2021. | The lower chart zooms into the pandemic portion of the line chart from 2020 to 2021. | . In order to do this, I will create a Matplotlib Figure with two Axes (subplots), as described above. . # There is an upper and lower subplot. fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots( nrows = 2, ncols = 1, figsize = (10, 10), # 10 inches x 10 inches dpi = 80, ) . The Upper Subplot . Next, we design the upper subplot. Here&#39;s what it looks like with a basic line chart of the raw exchange rate data. . ax1.plot( php[&quot;date&quot;], php[&quot;usd_php&quot;], color = c_blue, ) fig . The line above looks messy. For the general audience, the overall trends are more important than the specific daily values. Thus, we will use the rolling average to make the chart cleaner. . ax1.clear() ax1.plot( php[&quot;date&quot;], php[&quot;rolling&quot;], color = c_blue, ) fig . Additionally, we will split the line into: . The pre-pandemic portion (blue) | The pandemic portion (orange) | . The pandemic portion will also be enclosed in a dark gray box, in order to further separate it from the pre-pandemic portion. . ax1.clear() # Main line chart (2011-2019) php_pre = php.loc[php[&quot;date&quot;].dt.year &lt; 2020] ax1.plot( php_pre[&quot;date&quot;], php_pre[&quot;rolling&quot;], color = c_blue, ) # Pandemic part of line chart (2020-2021) php_pandemic = php.loc[php[&quot;date&quot;].dt.year.between(2020, 2021)] ax1.plot( php_pandemic[&quot;date&quot;], php_pandemic[&quot;rolling&quot;], color = c_orange, ) # Special background for pandemic portion ax1.axvspan( &quot;2020-01&quot;, &quot;2021-05-25&quot;, facecolor = c_dark_gray, alpha = 1, ) fig . Next, we want to maximize the data-ink ratio by removing unnecessary elements. We will do the following: . On the x-axis, show only the labels for 2012, 2016, and 2020. | On the y-axis, show only the labels for 48, 50, and 52. | Remove grid lines. | . We will also add 1 grid line at y = 50 so that it can guide viewers. It would be particularly helpful for Filipino viewers since they commonly think that USD 1 = PHP 50. . ax1.tick_params(axis = &#39;both&#39;, colors = &#39;gray&#39;) # Specific tick labels ax1.set_xticks([&quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;]) ax1.set_xticklabels([&quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;]) ax1.set_yticks([48, 50, 52]) ax1.set_yticklabels([&quot;48&quot;, &quot;50&quot;, &quot;52&quot;]) # Remove grid ax1.grid(False) # Horizontal line at y = 50 ax1.axhline(50, linewidth = 1, color = &quot;gray&quot;) fig . Now, the upper subplot is much cleaner; there is less visual noise. . The last step for the upper subplot would be to add informative text: . &quot;Pre-Pandemic&quot; label for the blue line | A comment about the upward trend leading up to 2018 | . ax1.text( x = &quot;2013-07&quot;, y = 48, s = &quot;Pre-Pandemic&quot;, color = &quot;gray&quot;, size = 14, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # Comment on upward trend ax1.text( x = &quot;2018-10&quot;, y = 46, s = &quot;Rate climbs up to 54 nin Oct 2018&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 11, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) fig . The &quot;Pre-Pandemic&quot; label was set to gray because it is a structural element; it is less important. . On the other hand, the long comment was set to black because it states a statistic from the data and helps tell a story about the data. It is more important, so it should be darker. . We have finished designing the upper subplot. . Lower Subplot . Next, the lower subplot will zoom in on the pandemic portion of the data, which is from 2020 to 2021. Since this is the more important part, we should use the raw data for more detail. . ax2.plot( php_pandemic[&quot;date&quot;], php_pandemic[&quot;usd_php&quot;], color = c_orange, ) fig . Then, we will make changes similar to the ones done for the upper subplot: . On the x-axis, show only the labels for January 2020, July 2020, and January 2021. | On the y-axis, show only the labels for 48, 50, and 52. | Remove grid lines. | Add 1 grid line at y = 50. | Enclose the entire line in a dark gray box. | . ax2.tick_params(axis = &#39;both&#39;, colors = &#39;gray&#39;) # Specific tick labels. ax2.set_xticks([&quot;2020-01&quot;, &quot;2020-07&quot;, &quot;2021-01&quot;]) ax2.set_xticklabels([&#39;Jan 2020&#39;, &#39;Jul 2020&#39;, &#39;Jan 2021&#39;]) ax2.set_yticks([48, 50, 52]) ax2.set_yticklabels([&quot;48&quot;, &quot;50&quot;, &quot;52&quot;]) # Remove grid ax2.grid(False) # Horizontal line at y = 50 ax2.axhline(50, linewidth = 1, color = &quot;gray&quot;) # Special background for pandemic portion ax2.axvspan( &quot;2020-01&quot;, &quot;2021-05-25&quot;, facecolor = c_dark_gray, alpha = 2, ) fig . We are using the principles of enclosure and similarity to visually imply that the pandemic portion in the upper subplot is being shown more closely in the lower subplot. . Enclosure: dark gray boxes | Similarity: orange lines, horizontal grid line, y-axis labels | . Next, we add another comment in black text, this time about the downward trend leading up to the present day. . ax2.text( x = &quot;2021-01&quot;, y = 49.25, s = &quot;Rate drops down to 48 nin May 2021&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 11, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) fig . We have finished designing the lower subplot. However, we still need to add some finishing touches. . Figure-Level Customization . In this last step, we customize the chart on the level of the Matplotlib Figure. This involves both of the subplots and the space around them. . What we want to do is to use the principles of proximity and connection to make the relationship between the 2 subplots even clearer. . Proximity: Increase the space between the two subplots. | Connection: Draw a line connecting the two dark gray boxes. Add a &quot;COVID-19 Pandemic&quot; label next to the line. | . | . These are done in the code below. . fig.tight_layout(pad = 5) # Line connection between gray boxes fig.add_artist( lines.Line2D( xdata = [0.82, 0.82], ydata = [0.44, 0.585], color = c_dark_gray, alpha = 1, ) ) # &quot;COVID-19&quot; label between subplots fig.text( x = 0.8, y = 0.5, s = &quot;COVID-19 Pandemic&quot;, color = &quot;gray&quot;, size = 14, ha = &quot;right&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) fig . Now, when one first reads the chart, it is very clear that the gray boxes contain data about exchange rates in the COVID-19 pandemic. . The last touch would be to add a title and subtitle to the chart. Since the title is typically the first thing a viewer reads on a chart, it is best to state a statistic related to the data, like &quot;USD-PHP Rate Drops to 48 after 1 Year in the Pandemic.&quot; . This way, the title becomes a data element. The data-ink ratio is increased. . fig.text( x = 0.5, y = 0.95, s = &quot;USD-PHP Rate Drops to 48 after 1 Year in the Pandemic&quot;, size = 16, weight = &quot;bold&quot;, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # Subtitle fig.text( x = 0.5, y = 0.92, s = &quot;USD-PHP exchange rate over time&quot;, size = 12, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) fig . That&#39;s it. The explanatory chart is complete. . Full Code . The full code to make the graph is shown below. The comments explain which part does what. . style.use(&quot;fivethirtyeight&quot;) # Color hex codes c_blue = &quot;#14c4dd&quot; c_orange = &quot;#ffa500&quot; c_dark_gray = &quot;#d2d2d2&quot; # Figure has 2 rows and 1 column. # There is an upper and lower subplot. fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots( nrows = 2, ncols = 1, figsize = (10, 10), dpi = 80, ) # UPPER subplot # Main line chart (2011-2019) php_pre = php.loc[php[&quot;date&quot;].dt.year &lt; 2020] ax1.plot( php_pre[&quot;date&quot;], php_pre[&quot;rolling&quot;], color = c_blue, ) # Pandemic part of line chart (2020-2021) php_pandemic = php.loc[php[&quot;date&quot;].dt.year.between(2020, 2021)] ax1.plot( php_pandemic[&quot;date&quot;], php_pandemic[&quot;rolling&quot;], color = c_orange, ) # Special background for pandemic portion ax1.axvspan( &quot;2020-01&quot;, &quot;2021-05-25&quot;, facecolor = c_dark_gray, alpha = 1, ) # Set tick label color to gray. ax1.tick_params(axis = &#39;both&#39;, colors = &#39;gray&#39;) # Specific tick labels ax1.set_xticks([&quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;]) ax1.set_xticklabels([&quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;]) ax1.set_yticks([48, 50, 52]) ax1.set_yticklabels([&quot;48&quot;, &quot;50&quot;, &quot;52&quot;]) # Remove grid ax1.grid(False) # Horizontal line at y = 50 ax1.axhline(50, linewidth = 1, color = &quot;gray&quot;) # Text in upper subplot ax1.text( x = &quot;2018-10&quot;, y = 46, s = &quot;Rate climbs up to 54 nin Oct 2018&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 11, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) ax1.text( x = &quot;2013-07&quot;, y = 48, s = &quot;Pre-Pandemic&quot;, color = &quot;gray&quot;, size = 14, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # LOWER subplot # Pandemic portion, zoomed in ax2.plot( php_pandemic[&quot;date&quot;], php_pandemic[&quot;usd_php&quot;], color = c_orange, ) # Set tick labels to gray. ax2.tick_params(axis = &#39;both&#39;, colors = &#39;gray&#39;) # Specific tick labels. ax2.set_xticks([&quot;2020-01&quot;, &quot;2020-07&quot;, &quot;2021-01&quot;]) ax2.set_xticklabels([&#39;Jan 2020&#39;, &#39;Jul 2020&#39;, &#39;Jan 2021&#39;]) ax2.set_yticks([48, 50, 52]) ax2.set_yticklabels([&quot;48&quot;, &quot;50&quot;, &quot;52&quot;]) # Remove grid ax2.grid(False) # Horizontal line at y = 50 ax2.axhline(50, linewidth = 1, color = &quot;gray&quot;) # Special background for pandemic portion ax2.axvspan( &quot;2020-01&quot;, &quot;2021-05-25&quot;, facecolor = c_dark_gray, alpha = 2, ) # Text in lower subplot ax2.text( x = &quot;2021-01&quot;, y = 49.25, s = &quot;Rate drops down to 48 nin May 2021&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 11, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # FIGURE level customization # Add space between the subplots fig.tight_layout(pad = 5) # Line connection between pandemic parts fig.add_artist( lines.Line2D( xdata = [0.82, 0.82], ydata = [0.44, 0.585], color = c_dark_gray, alpha = 1, ) ) # Title with statistic fig.text( x = 0.5, y = 0.95, s = &quot;USD-PHP Rate Drops to 48 after 1 Year in the Pandemic&quot;, size = 16, weight = &quot;bold&quot;, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # Subtitle fig.text( x = 0.5, y = 0.92, s = &quot;USD-PHP exchange rate over time&quot;, size = 12, ha = &quot;center&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # &quot;COVID-19&quot; label between subplots fig.text( x = 0.8, y = 0.5, s = &quot;COVID-19 Pandemic&quot;, color = &quot;gray&quot;, size = 14, ha = &quot;right&quot;, va = &quot;center&quot;, ) # Save chart locally. plt.savefig(&quot;./2021-05-28-MEC-Files/2021-05-28-explanatory-chart.png&quot;) # Show chart plt.show() . Conclusion . In this project, we cleaned and explored data about USD-PHP exchange rates over time. . We then discussed several key concepts in the creation of an explanatory chart, such as Familiarity, Data-Ink Ratio, and Gestalt Psychology. These concepts were applied throughout the process of making an explanatory chart that compared exchange rate trends before and during the pandemic. . We were ultimately able to create a chart that is simple and clean, yet eye-catching and informative. . Thanks for reading! .",

            "title": "Indicators of Heavy Traffic on the I-94 Highway",
            "content": ". Unsplash | Alexander Popov Overview . Interstate 94 or I-94 is a highway in the USA that stretches from Montana in the west to Michigan in the east. In 2019, John Hogue donated a dataset of traffic volume, weather, and holiday data on I-94 from 2012 to 2018. This can be found on the following UCI Machine Learning Repository page: Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set. . The goal of this project is to determine possible indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. Exploratory data analysis will be conducted with Seaborn visualizations. . Note: I wrote this notebook for the Dataquest course&#8217;s Guided Project: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94. The general project flow and research questions came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. . Package Installs . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns . Data Overview . The following details about the I-94 dataset are stated in the archive. . holiday: Categorical; US National holidays plus regional holiday, Minnesota State Fair | temp: Numeric; Average temperature (Kelvin) | rain_1h: Numeric; Amount (mm) of rain that occurred in the hour | snow_1h: Numeric; Amount (mm) of snow that occurred in the hour | clouds_all: Numeric; Percentage of cloud cover (%) | weather_main: Categorical; Short textual description of the current weather | weather_description: Categorical; Longer textual description of the current weather | date_time: DateTime; Hour of the data collected in local CST time | traffic_volume: Numeric; Hourly I-94 ATR 301 reported westbound traffic volume . Note: The data were collected from a station somewhere between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Only westbound traffic was recorded, not eastbound. The data are not representative of the entire I-94 highway. | . Below are the first few rows of the dataset. . highway = pd.read_csv(&quot;./2021-05-25-IHT-Files/Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv&quot;) highway.head() . holiday temp rain_1h snow_1h clouds_all weather_main weather_description date_time traffic_volume . 0 None | 288.28 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 40 | Clouds | scattered clouds | 2012-10-02 09:00:00 | 5545 | . 1 None | 289.36 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 75 | Clouds | broken clouds | 2012-10-02 10:00:00 | 4516 | . 2 None | 289.58 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 90 | Clouds | overcast clouds | 2012-10-02 11:00:00 | 4767 | . 3 None | 290.13 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 90 | Clouds | overcast clouds | 2012-10-02 12:00:00 | 5026 | . 4 None | 291.14 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 75 | Clouds | broken clouds | 2012-10-02 13:00:00 | 4918 | . There are columns about the date, traffic volume, weather, and occurrence of holidays. With this dataset, one could determine how traffic or weather changed over time. One could also determine how weather and holidays affected traffic volume. . Let us view the information on each column below. . highway.info() . &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 48204 entries, 0 to 48203 Data columns (total 9 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype -- -- 0 holiday 48204 non-null object 1 temp 48204 non-null float64 2 rain_1h 48204 non-null float64 3 snow_1h 48204 non-null float64 4 clouds_all 48204 non-null int64 5 weather_main 48204 non-null object 6 weather_description 48204 non-null object 7 date_time 48204 non-null object 8 traffic_volume 48204 non-null int64 dtypes: float64(3), int64(2), object(4) memory usage: 3.3+ MB . It turns out that most of the numeric columns are float64, which refers to decimal numbers. . The integer columns are clouds_all, which is in percentage, and traffic volume, which tells the number of cars. . The date_time column is listed as an object or text column. Let&#39;s convert this to datetime format for ease of use. . highway[&quot;date_time&quot;] = pd.to_datetime(highway[&quot;date_time&quot;]) highway[&quot;date_time&quot;] . 0 2012-10-02 09:00:00 1 2012-10-02 10:00:00 2 2012-10-02 11:00:00 3 2012-10-02 12:00:00 4 2012-10-02 13:00:00 ... 48199 2018-09-30 19:00:00 48200 2018-09-30 20:00:00 48201 2018-09-30 21:00:00 48202 2018-09-30 22:00:00 48203 2018-09-30 23:00:00 Name: date_time, Length: 48204, dtype: datetime64[ns] . Lastly, all of the Non-Null Counts match the total number of datapoints (48204). This could mean that there are no missing values in the dataset. It could also mean that missing values are expressed in a non-conventional way. . Data Cleaning . Duplicate Entries . There may be duplicate entries, i.e., multiple entries for the same date and hour. These must be removed. . highway.drop_duplicates( subset = [&quot;date_time&quot;], keep = &quot;first&quot;, inplace = True, ) highway.shape . (40575, 9) . There were 7629 duplicate entries removed from the original 48204 entries. . Descriptive Statistics . Next, we view the descriptive statistics in order to find abnormal values. . highway.describe( include = &quot;all&quot;, datetime_is_numeric = True, ) . holiday temp rain_1h snow_1h clouds_all weather_main weather_description date_time traffic_volume . count 40575 | 40575.000000 | 40575.000000 | 40575.000000 | 40575.000000 | 40575 | 40575 | 40575 | 40575.000000 | . unique 12 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 11 | 35 | NaN | NaN | . top None | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | Clouds | sky is clear | NaN | NaN | . freq 40522 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 15123 | 11642 | NaN | NaN | . mean NaN | 281.316763 | 0.318632 | 0.000117 | 44.199162 | NaN | NaN | 2015-12-23 22:16:28.835489792 | 3290.650474 | . min NaN | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2012-10-02 09:00:00 | 0.000000 | . 25% NaN | 271.840000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 1.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2014-02-02 19:30:00 | 1248.500000 | . 50% NaN | 282.860000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 40.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2016-06-02 14:00:00 | 3427.000000 | . 75% NaN | 292.280000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 90.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2017-08-02 23:30:00 | 4952.000000 | . max NaN | 310.070000 | 9831.300000 | 0.510000 | 100.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2018-09-30 23:00:00 | 7280.000000 | . std NaN | 13.816618 | 48.812640 | 0.005676 | 38.683447 | NaN | NaN | NaN | 1984.772909 | . Most of the descriptives make sense, except for a few details: . The minimum temp is 0 Kelvin. This is called absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature of any object, equivalent to $-273.15^{ circ} text{C}$. It is unreasonable for the I-94 highway to reach such a low temperature, even in winter. | The maximum rain_1h is 9,831 mm, or 9.8 meters. Either this indicates a very high flood, or this is inaccurate. | The minimum traffic_volume is 0 cars. This may be possible, but it is still best to inspect the data. | . Temperature Outliers . Let us graph a boxplot in order to find outliers among the temperature values. . sns.boxplot( data = highway, y = &quot;temp&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Temperature on I-94 (Kelvin)&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Temperature (Kelvin)&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Indeed, most values fall between 250 Kelvin and 300 Kelvin ($-23.15^{ circ} text{C}$ and $26.85^{ circ} text{C}$). The only outliers are at 0 Kelvin. This supports the idea that the zeroes are placeholders for missing values. . How many missing values are there? . (highway[&quot;temp&quot;] .value_counts(bins = 10) .sort_index() ) . (-0.311, 31.007] 10 (31.007, 62.014] 0 (62.014, 93.021] 0 (93.021, 124.028] 0 (124.028, 155.035] 0 (155.035, 186.042] 0 (186.042, 217.049] 0 (217.049, 248.056] 99 (248.056, 279.063] 17372 (279.063, 310.07] 23094 Name: temp, dtype: int64 . Only 10 datapoints have zero-values in temp. Thus, these can be dropped from the dataset. . highway = highway.loc[highway[&quot;temp&quot;] != 0] highway.shape . (40565, 9) . Now, there are 40565 rows in the dataset. Temperature outliers have been removed. . Rain Level Outliers . Similarly, we graph a boxplot below for the rain_1h column. . sns.boxplot( data = highway, y = &quot;rain_1h&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Hourly Rain Level on I-94 (mm)&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Hourly Rain Level (mm)&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Most of the values are close to 0 mm, and there are only a few outliers near 10,000 mm. How many outliers are there? . highway[&quot;rain_1h&quot;].value_counts(bins = 10).sort_index() .

There is only 1 outlying datapoint. Since a 9.8 m flood level is so unrealistic given that most of the other values are small, this datapoint will be dropped. . highway = highway.loc[highway[&quot;rain_1h&quot;] &lt; 1000] highway.shape . (40564, 9) . The dataset is left with 40564 rows. . Traffic Volume Outliers . Below is the boxplot of traffic volume values. We want to see if the zero-values are reasonable or if these are distant outliers. . sns.boxplot( data = highway, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Traffic Volume on I-94&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The boxplot shows that 0 is within the approximate lower bound. It is not too distant from most of the datapoints to be considered an outlier. . Let us view a histogram to understand the distribution better. . sns.histplot( data = highway, x = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Traffic Volume on I-94&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . This is an unusual distribution. There appear to be 3 peaks: . less than 1000 cars | around 3000 cars | around 4500 cars | . It is common that less than 1000 cars pass through this I-94 station per hour. Therefore, it is likely that the 0-values are not outliers and do not need to be dropped from the dataset. . Data cleaning is done, so here are the new descriptive statistics for the dataset. . highway.describe( include = &quot;all&quot;, datetime_is_numeric = True, ) . holiday temp rain_1h snow_1h clouds_all weather_main weather_description date_time traffic_volume . count 40564 | 40564.000000 | 40564.000000 | 40564.000000 | 40564.000000 | 40564 | 40564 | 40564 | 40564.000000 | . unique 12 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 11 | 35 | NaN | NaN | . top None | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | Clouds | sky is clear | NaN | NaN | . freq 40511 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 15123 | 11632 | NaN | NaN | . mean NaN | 281.385602 | 0.076353 | 0.000117 | 44.209299 | NaN | NaN | 2015-12-24 02:14:28.937974528 | 3291.081402 | . min NaN | 243.390000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2012-10-02 09:00:00 | 0.000000 | . 25% NaN | 271.850000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 1.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2014-02-03 02:45:00 | 1249.750000 | . 50% NaN | 282.867500 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 40.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2016-06-02 19:30:00 | 3429.000000 | . 75% NaN | 292.280000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 90.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2017-08-03 02:15:00 | 4952.000000 | . max NaN | 310.070000 | 55.630000 | 0.510000 | 100.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2018-09-30 23:00:00 | 7280.000000 | . std NaN | 13.092942 | 0.769729 | 0.005677 | 38.682163 | NaN | NaN | NaN | 1984.638849 | . Due to data cleaning, the following have changed: . Minimum temp is 243.39 Kelvin | Maximum rain_1h is 55.63 mm | . These are more reasonable values than before. . Exploratory Data Analysis . Traffic Volume: Day vs. Night . At the end of the data cleaning, we noticed that there were 3 peaks (most common values) in the traffic volume data. It is possible that this can be explained by comparing traffic volume between daytime and nighttime. . In order to do this, we can make a new column half which labels each entry as &quot;day&quot; or &quot;night.&quot; We will consider daytime to be from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, or 6:00 to 18:00. . highway[&quot;half&quot;] = ( highway[&quot;date_time&quot;] .dt.hour.between(6, 17) # Boolean Series where True represents day .replace({True: &quot;day&quot;, False: &quot;night&quot;}) # Replace booleans with strings ) highway[&quot;half&quot;].value_counts() . night 20418 day 20146 Name: half, dtype: int64 . There are 20418 nighttime entries and 20146 daytime entries. . Now we can compare the day and night histograms for traffic volume. . sns.histplot( data = highway, x = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, hue = &quot;half&quot;, palette = &quot;RdBu&quot;, ) plt.title(&quot;Traffic Volume on I-94: Day and Night&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The histogram above shows that: . In the nighttime, the traffic volume is commonly under 1000 or around 3000. | In the daytime, the traffic volume is commonly around 5000. | . Therefore, traffic is generally heavier in the daytime, between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM. . Since we want to determine what influences heavy traffic, it would be best to focus our analysis on the daytime entries. Thus, such entries will be put in a separate DataFrame called daytime. . daytime = ( highway .loc[highway[&quot;half&quot;] == &quot;day&quot;] .drop(columns = &quot;half&quot;) ) daytime.describe( include = &quot;all&quot;, datetime_is_numeric = True, ) . holiday temp rain_1h snow_1h clouds_all weather_main weather_description date_time traffic_volume . count 20146 | 20146.000000 | 20146.000000 | 20146.000000 | 20146.000000 | 20146 | 20146 | 20146 | 20146.000000 | . unique 1 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 10 | 33 | NaN | NaN | . top None | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | Clouds | sky is clear | NaN | NaN | . freq 20146 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 8360 | 4971 | NaN | NaN | . mean NaN | 282.018771 | 0.076210 | 0.000124 | 47.342500 | NaN | NaN | 2015-12-26 11:32:49.582050816 | 4784.630100 | . min NaN | 243.390000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2012-10-02 09:00:00 | 1.000000 | . 25% NaN | 272.220000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 1.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2014-02-04 08:15:00 | 4311.000000 | . 50% NaN | 283.640000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 40.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2016-06-07 11:30:00 | 4943.000000 | . 75% NaN | 293.370000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 90.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2017-08-06 09:45:00 | 5678.000000 | . max NaN | 310.070000 | 44.450000 | 0.510000 | 100.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2018-09-30 17:00:00 | 7280.000000 | . std NaN | 13.330019 | 0.737429 | 0.005673 | 37.808456 | NaN | NaN | NaN | 1293.502893 | . This DataFrame contains only 20146 rows. The descriptive statistics are naturally somewhat different from before. . Effect of Units of Time . It is possible that traffic volume is influenced by certain units of time. For example, it could be influenced by the month, the day of the week, or the hour of the day. In this section, we investigate these factors. . By Month . First, does the month affect the traffic volume? . Let us make a new column that indicates the month as a number. . daytime[&quot;month&quot;] = daytime[&quot;date_time&quot;].dt.month daytime[&quot;month&quot;] . 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 .. 48191 9 48192 9 48194 9 48196 9 48197 9 Name: month, Length: 20146, dtype: int64 . Then, we can calculate and graph the average traffic volume per month. The median will be used instead of the mean since the data are not normally distributed. . Table: . (daytime .groupby(&quot;month&quot;) .median() [[&quot;traffic_volume&quot;]] ) . traffic_volume . month . 1 4651.5 | . 2 4886.0 | . 3 5062.0 | . 4 5105.0 | . 5 5052.0 | . 6 5050.0 | . 7 4799.5 | . 8 5056.0 | . 9 4925.5 | . 10 5056.0 | . 11 4876.0 | . 12 4722.0 | . Line chart: . sns.lineplot( data = daytime, x = &quot;month&quot;, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Month on Traffic Volume&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Month&quot;), plt.ylabel(&quot;Median Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The line chart shows that the median traffic volume is highest in April, possibly because this is in spring. Traffic volume is lowest in January and December since these are in the middle of winter. July also has less traffic since it is in the middle of summer. . By Day of the Week . Next, we will investigate the effect of the day of the week on the traffic volume. . daytime[&quot;day&quot;] = daytime[&quot;date_time&quot;].dt.dayofweek (daytime .groupby(&quot;day&quot;) .median() [[&quot;traffic_volume&quot;]] ) . traffic_volume . day . 0 4971.5 | . 1 5268.0 | . 2 5355.0 | . 3 5404.0 | . 4 5399.0 | . 5 4194.0 | . 6 3737.0 | . Note that 0 means Monday and 6 means Sunday. . The corresponding line chart is shown below. . sns.lineplot( data = daytime, x = &quot;day&quot;, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Day of Week on Traffic Volume&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Day of the Week&quot;), plt.ylabel(&quot;Median Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The line chart shows that the traffic volume is very high from Monday to Friday, then dips by 1000 cars on Saturday and Sunday. It makes sense that traffic is heavier on weekdays and lighter on weekends. . By Hour of the Day . Lastly, we will investigate the effect of the time of day on the traffic volume. Since we have narrowed the dataset down to daytime entries, only hours from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM are included. . First, though, let&#39;s make a column that indicates weekdays and weekends so that we can compare them. . daytime[&quot;day_type&quot;] = daytime[&quot;day&quot;].replace({ 0: &quot;business day&quot;, 1: &quot;business day&quot;, 2: &quot;business day&quot;, 3: &quot;business day&quot;, 4: &quot;business day&quot;, 5: &quot;weekend&quot;, 6: &quot;weekend&quot;, }) . Next, below is the table of median traffic volume grouped by the day of the week and the type of day. . daytime[&quot;hour&quot;] = daytime[&quot;date_time&quot;].dt.hour (daytime .groupby([&quot;hour&quot;, &quot;day_type&quot;]) .median() [[&quot;traffic_volume&quot;]] ) . traffic_volume . hour day_type . 6 business day 5588.0 | . weekend 1092.0 | . 7 business day 6320.5 | . weekend 1547.0 | . 8 business day 5751.0 | . weekend 2268.0 | . 9 business day 5053.0 | . weekend 3147.0 | . 10 business day 4484.5 | . weekend 3722.0 | . 11 business day 4714.0 | . weekend 4114.0 | . 12 business day 4921.0 | . weekend 4442.5 | . 13 business day 4919.5 | . weekend 4457.0 | . 14 business day 5232.0 | . weekend 4457.0 | . 15 business day 5740.0 | . weekend 4421.0 | . 16 business day 6403.5 | . weekend 4438.0 | . 17 business day 5987.0 | . weekend 4261.5 | . The hours are in 24-hour time; 17:00 represents the hour from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. . In order to understand this table better, we can visualize it in the line chart below. . sns.lineplot( data = daytime, x = &quot;hour&quot;, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, hue = &quot;day_type&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Hour of Day on Traffic Volume&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Hour of the Day&quot;), plt.ylabel(&quot;Median Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.legend(title = &quot;Day Type&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . On business days, traffic is heaviest at 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM. These are the times when people travel to or from work. Traffic is lightest around noontime. . On weekends, traffic volume increases from 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM and plateaus from there on. People are free to travel at any time on weekends since most don&#39;t have work. However, the number of cars is still lower on weekends compared to business days. . Effect of Weather . Up until now, we have investigated the possible effects of different units of time on the traffic volume. In this section, we focus on how traffic is affected by the weather. . The following are the weather-related columns in the dataset: . temp | rain_1h | snow_1h | clouds_all | weather_main | weather_description | . The first 4 are numerical and the last 2 are categorical. . Numerical Weather Columns . Let us inspect the Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient between traffic volume and each of the numerical weather columns. . daytime.corr().loc[ [&quot;temp&quot;, &quot;rain_1h&quot;, &quot;snow_1h&quot;, &quot;clouds_all&quot;], [&quot;traffic_volume&quot;] ] . traffic_volume . temp 0.124311 | . rain_1h -0.022817 | . snow_1h -0.004145 | . clouds_all 0.000621 | . All 4 numerical weather columns appear to have very weak correlations with traffic volume. . The highest correlation involves temperature, but the coefficient is only 12.43. This indicates a weak positive relationship. As temperature increases, traffic volume also increases, but not consistently. . We can understand the correlation better using a scatter plot. . sns.scatterplot( data = daytime, x = &quot;temp&quot;, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Temperature on Traffic Volume&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Temperature (Kelvin)&quot;), plt.ylabel(&quot;Median Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Unfortunately, the datapoints are scattered quite consistently throughout all combinations of temperature and traffic volume. The correlation is weak; temperature is not a reliable indicator of traffic. Neither are the other numerical weather columns, since their coefficients were even weaker. . Categorical Weather Columns . Next, we&#39;ll see if the categorical weather columns can serve as better indicators of heavy traffic. . Short Descriptions of Weather . The weather_main column contains short, 1-word descriptions of the weather. . What are the categories under weather_main? . daytime[&quot;weather_main&quot;].value_counts() . Clouds 8360 Clear 5821 Rain 2392 Mist 1441 Snow 1165 Haze 472 Drizzle 223 Thunderstorm 175 Fog 90 Smoke 7 Name: weather_main, dtype: int64 . Clouds, Clear, and Rain are the most frequent descriptions of the weather. . Next, let us investigate the effect of the weather description on the traffic volume. The table is shown below. . (daytime .groupby(&quot;weather_main&quot;) .median() [[&quot;traffic_volume&quot;]] ) . traffic_volume . weather_main . Clear 4936.0 | . Clouds 4974.5 | . Drizzle 5132.0 | . Fog 5588.0 | . Haze 4817.5 | . Mist 5053.0 | . Rain 4975.0 | . Smoke 4085.0 | . Snow 4570.0 | . Thunderstorm 4875.0 | . This is visualized in the bar plot below. . sns.barplot( data = daytime, x = &quot;weather_main&quot;, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Short Weather Description on Traffic Volume&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Short Weather Description&quot;), plt.ylabel(&quot;Median Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 45) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . The traffic volume appears to be mostly consistent across short weather descriptions. Notably: . Traffic is heaviest during fog (5588 cars). | Traffic is lightest when there is smoke (4085 cars). | . However, the effects are quite small, reaching only up to a difference of 1000 cars. . Long Descriptions of Weather . The weather_description column contains longer descriptions of the weather. . Below are its categories. . daytime[&quot;weather_description&quot;].value_counts() . sky is clear 4971 broken clouds 2683 overcast clouds 2526 scattered clouds 2068 mist 1441 light rain 1415 few clouds 1083 Sky is Clear 850 light snow 811 moderate rain 666 haze 472 heavy snow 249 heavy intensity rain 207 light intensity drizzle 160 proximity thunderstorm 136 snow 90 fog 90 proximity shower rain 89 drizzle 57 thunderstorm 22 light shower snow 11 smoke 7 very heavy rain 7 light intensity shower rain 7 thunderstorm with light rain 7 heavy intensity drizzle 6 thunderstorm with heavy rain 5 thunderstorm with rain 3 sleet 3 proximity thunderstorm with rain 1 proximity thunderstorm with drizzle 1 light rain and snow 1 freezing rain 1 Name: weather_description, dtype: int64 . Notice that there is a sky is clear value and a Sky is Clear value with different capitalization. It is likely that these two categories mean the same thing, so let us combine them. . daytime[&quot;weather_description&quot;].replace( {&quot;Sky is Clear&quot;: &quot;sky is clear&quot;}, inplace = True, ) daytime[&quot;weather_description&quot;].value_counts().head() . sky is clear 5821 broken clouds 2683 overcast clouds 2526 scattered clouds 2068 mist 1441 Name: weather_description, dtype: int64 . The sky is clear category now has 5821 entries. . Now that that&#39;s cleaned, let&#39;s make a table showing the effect of the long weather description on the traffic volume. . (daytime .groupby(&quot;weather_description&quot;) .median() [[&quot;traffic_volume&quot;]] ) . traffic_volume . weather_description . broken clouds 4925.0 | . drizzle 5132.0 | . few clouds 4977.0 | . fog 5588.0 | . freezing rain 4762.0 | . haze 4817.5 | . heavy intensity drizzle 5824.5 | . heavy intensity rain 4922.0 | . heavy snow 4673.0 | . light intensity drizzle 5086.5 | . light intensity shower rain 4695.0 | . light rain 5011.0 | . light rain and snow 5544.0 | . light shower snow 4324.0 | . light snow 4601.0 | . mist 5053.0 | . moderate rain 4940.0 | . overcast clouds 4968.0 | . proximity shower rain 4910.0 | . proximity thunderstorm 4849.5 | . proximity thunderstorm with drizzle 6667.0 | . proximity thunderstorm with rain 5730.0 | . scattered clouds 5032.5 | . sky is clear 4936.0 | . sleet 5174.0 | . smoke 4085.0 | . snow 4032.0 | . thunderstorm 5578.0 | . thunderstorm with heavy rain 5278.0 | . thunderstorm with light rain 4073.0 | . thunderstorm with rain 4270.0 | . very heavy rain 4802.0 | . The table is visualized in the bar graph below. . plt.figure(figsize = (14, 5)) sns.barplot( data = daytime, x = &quot;weather_description&quot;, y = &quot;traffic_volume&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Long Weather Description on Traffic Volume&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Long Weather Description&quot;), plt.ylabel(&quot;Median Hourly Number of Cars&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation = 45, ha = &quot;right&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.show() . Similar to the bar graph of short weather descriptions, most of the values are around 5000 cars. Notably: . Traffic is heaviest in a proximity thunderstorm with drizzle (6667 cars). The word &quot;proximity&quot; was likely used to emphasize that the storm was very close to the station. | It makes sense that a drizzling thunderstorm directly over the highway would reduce visibility and make traffic pile up. | . | Traffic is lightest in snow (4032 cars). It is likely that more people choose not to travel outside when it is snowing. | . | . Conclusion . This project aimed to determine reliable indicators of heavy traffic along the I-94 highway. Data were narrowed down to daytime (as opposed to nighttime) entries, which have higher traffic volumes. Exploratory data analysis was conducted using mostly Seaborn visualizations. . The following conclusions were drawn: . Time has various effects on traffic volume. Traffic is heavier when: It is daytime (between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM). | The month is from March to June. | The day is a business day, as opposed to a weekend. | The hour is 7:00 AM or 4:00 PM on a business day. | . | . . Weather affects traffic volume to a lesser extent. Traffic is heavier when: There is fog on the road (or other visual obstructions). | There is a nearby thunderstorm with drizzle or rain. | . | . .

            "content": ". Unsplash | Parker Gibbs Overview . In 2016, Kaggle user orgezleka scraped data about used car advertisements on eBay Kleinanzeigen, which is the eBay Classifieds website of Germany. The full dataset is still available on Used Cars Data (data.world 2016), with over 370,000 datapoints. . The project aims to answer the following questions: . Which brands of the used cars are most expensive? | Does a used car&#39;s age affect its price? | Does a used car&#39;s mileage affect its price? | Does the presence of unrepaired damage affect a car&#39;s price? | . More importantly, this project aims to showcase basic data cleaning procedures. Thus, even columns beyond the scope of the research questions will be considered for cleaning. The assumption is that analysis will eventually be performed on all columns. . Note: I wrote this notebook for the Dataquest course&#8217;s Guided Project: Exploring eBay Car Sales Data. The general project flow came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. .

The dataset has 371,528 rows and 20 columns. Each column contains one of two types of data: . int64: 64-bit integers | object: text strings | . Also, some columns have a non-null count smaller than the number of entries. This means that there are missing values in these columns. The column notRepairedDamagehas the most missing values. . Data Cleaning . Column Labels . As seen earlier, all of the column labels are written in camel case. This means that the first letter of each word is capitalized, like CamelCase. . Column labels should ideally be written in snake_case so that these are easier to use. Thus, I will convert all column labels to snake case. . cols = list(autos.columns) new_cols = [] for label in cols: # List of indices of the first letter of each word. cap_inds = [0] + [index for index, character in enumerate(label) if character.isupper()] # List of 2-tuples.

Now, all of the column labels are in snake case.

All of the column labels are now easy to use. . Uninformative Columns . Next, we will look for columns filled with mostly 1 value. The other values in them are underrepresented, so we wouldn&#39;t be able to compare groups reliably. .

The top row gives the most frequent value in the column. The freq row tells exactly how often the top value occurs. . We can see that in the seller column, &quot;privat&quot; appears 371,525 times; this is close to the total number of entries. Also, in the offer_type column, &quot;Angebot&quot; appears 371,516 times. . Let us first check the unique values of the seller column. . autos[&quot;seller&quot;].value_counts() . privat 371525 gewerblich 3 Name: seller, dtype: int64 . In English, these mean &quot;private&quot; and &quot;commercial.&quot; It is likely that private listings are put up by individuals, whereas commercial listings are put up by used car dealer companies. Most listings scraped were apparently private. . One idea is to compare private listing prices to commercial listing prices. However, there are only 3 commercial listings, so this comparison would be unreliable. Therefore, we can drop this column. . autos.drop(columns = &quot;seller&quot;, inplace = True) . Secondly, let&#39;s check the unique values of the offer_type column. . autos[&quot;offer_type&quot;].value_counts() . Angebot 371516 Gesuch 12 Name: offer_type, dtype: int64 . In English, these mean &quot;offer&quot; and &quot;request.&quot; This isn&#39;t very informative. It could have something to do with the system of sending Offers to buyers in eBay. In any case, it doesn&#39;t seem interesting to analyze, and there are only 12 request listings. Thus, we can also drop this column. . autos.drop(columns = &quot;offer_type&quot;, inplace = True) . Next, the numerical num_pictures column has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 0. . autos[&quot;num_pictures&quot;].describe() . count 371528.0 mean 0.0 std 0.0 min 0.0 25% 0.0 50% 0.0 75% 0.0 max 0.0 Name: num_pictures, dtype: float64 . This means that none of the listings for used cars were found to have pictures. This data may be true or it may have come from an error, but either way, it is not useful. Thus, it will be dropped. . autos.drop(columns = &quot;num_pictures&quot;, inplace = True) . Outliers in Numerical Columns . Next, we inspect the ranges of numerical columns to see if there are any unusually high or low values. . autos.describe(include = np.number) . price year_reg power_ps mileage_km month_reg postal_code . count 3.715280e+05 | 371528.000000 | 371528.000000 | 371528.000000 | 371528.000000 | 371528.00000 | . mean 1.729514e+04 | 2004.577997 | 115.549477 | 125618.688228 | 5.734445 | 50820.66764 | . std 3.587954e+06 | 92.866598 | 192.139578 | 40112.337051 | 3.712412 | 25799.08247 | . min 0.000000e+00 | 1000.000000 | 0.000000 | 5000.000000 | 0.000000 | 1067.00000 | . 25% 1.150000e+03 | 1999.000000 | 70.000000 | 125000.000000 | 3.000000 | 30459.00000 | . 50% 2.950000e+03 | 2003.000000 | 105.000000 | 150000.000000 | 6.000000 | 49610.00000 | . 75% 7.200000e+03 | 2008.000000 | 150.000000 | 150000.000000 | 9.000000 | 71546.00000 | . max 2.147484e+09 | 9999.000000 | 20000.000000 | 150000.000000 | 12.000000 | 99998.00000 | . The following unusual characteristics are noticeable: . price: The minimum price is 0 (free) and the maximum price is larger than 2 billion. | year_reg: The earliest year of registration is 1000, and the latest year is 9999. | power_ps: The lowest power is 0 PS. The highest is 20,000 PS, which is much higher than the 75th percentile (only 150 PS). | month_reg: The month numbers range from 0 to 12, not 1 to 12. | . All of these columns shall be cleaned of inaccurate data. . Price in Euros . It was seen that the minimum value for price data was 0, and the maximum is over 2,000,000,000. Since this data was scraped from the German eBay, we can assume that these prices are in euros. . Both the minimum and maximum values seem to be very unrealistic for the price of a used car, so we want to clean this data. . Let us create a frequency table of the prices. We will first sort it by price, ascending. . autos[&quot;price&quot;].value_counts().sort_index() . 0 10778 1 1189 2 12 3 8 4 1 ... 32545461 1 74185296 1 99000000 1 99999999 15 2147483647 1 Name: price, Length: 5597, dtype: int64 . Two things are noticeable: . There are over 10,000 instances of 0 euro prices. | There are several extremely high outliers, not just the one above 2 billion. | . Since it is unlikely that the cars are actually free, 0 may represent missing values. As for the high outliers, these may have resulted from inaccurate scraping. . The next question is, what is the most frequent price value? Is it 0? . autos[&quot;price&quot;].value_counts().sort_values(ascending = False) . 0 10778 500 5670 1500 5394 1000 4649 1200 4594 ... 6375 1 19986 1 36850 1 5913 1 8188 1 Name: price, Length: 5597, dtype: int64 . Indeed, the most frequent price is 0, which makes it likely that it represents missing values. The next most frequent prices are 500, 1500, and 1000, most likely because these are easy for buyers to remember. . Now that we know about the low and high outliers, we can clean rows using the interquartile range or IQR. The IQR is bounded by the 25th and 75th percentiles. Reasonable lower and upper bounds can be approximated by multiplying the IQR length by 1.5 and: . subtracting it from the 25th percentile | adding it to the 75th percentile | . Reference: Detection and Removal of Outliers in Python – An Easy to Understand Guide . Below, I use this method to find a lower and upper bound, and I drop rows outside of them. . autos_desc = autos[&quot;price&quot;].describe() q25, q75 = autos_desc[[&quot;25%&quot;, &quot;75%&quot;]] iqr = q75 - q25 lower_bound = q25 - 1.5 * iqr upper_bound = q75 + 1.5 * iqr autos = autos.loc[autos[&quot;price&quot;].between(lower_bound, upper_bound)] print(&quot;Lower bound:&quot;, lower_bound) print(&quot;Upper bound:&quot;, upper_bound) print(&quot;New shape:&quot;, autos.shape) . Lower bound: -7925.0 Upper bound: 16275.0 New shape: (343420, 17) . Now, there are 343,420 rows remaining in the dataset. This is still quite large; not too many datapoints were removed. . Let us view the new distribution of prices in a histogram. . ax = sns.histplot( data = autos, x = &quot;price&quot;, ) ax.set_title(&quot;Used Car Prices, Cleaned Using IQR&quot;) ax.grid(True) plt.show() . Unfortunately, since the lower bound was negative, unrealistically low prices close to 0 were still accepted within the range. . Remember from earlier that the 2nd most frequent price value was found to be 500 euros. This makes it likely that these were correct prices, rather than incorrectly scraped values. Thus, let us keep all price values greater than or equal to 500. . autos = autos.loc[autos[&quot;price&quot;] &gt;= 500] autos.shape . (307358, 17) . Now, 307,358 datapoints remain. Let us look at the final distribution of prices: . ax = sns.histplot( data = autos, x = &quot;price&quot;, ) ax.set_title(&quot;Used Car Prices, Cleaned of Low Values&quot;) ax.grid(True) plt.show() . The distribution is still right-skewed, but at least the price range in the dataset is more reasonable now. . Metric Horsepower . We saw earlier that some power values were at 0 PS, and others were as high as 20,000 PS. . Note: A measure of 1 PS (metric horsepower) is equivalent to 0.98 HP (horsepower). (Deriquito 2020) . autos[&quot;power_ps&quot;].describe() . count 307358.000000 mean 112.551842 std 191.557378 min 0.000000 25% 75.000000 50% 105.000000 75% 143.000000 max 20000.000000 Name: power_ps, dtype: float64 . Above are the new descriptive statistics for metric horsepower, after the transformations that we have done recently. . According to &quot;What is the Average Car Horsepower?&quot; (2021), cars usually have a horsepower of 100 HP to 400 HP, though some have less. Faster cars have 400 HP to 1,000 HP, and some supercars have over 1,000 HP. The equivalent values in PS would be slightly higher. . Considering that these are used cars, it is unlikely for them to be very fast much less to be supercars. Thus, we will keep cars with metric horsepowers between 50 and 450, in order to take as many of the realistic values as possible. . autos = autos.loc[autos[&quot;power_ps&quot;].between(50, 450)] autos[&quot;power_ps&quot;].describe() . count 274514.000000 mean 121.166931 std 50.535320 min 50.000000 25% 82.000000 50% 114.000000 75% 150.000000 max 450.000000 Name: power_ps, dtype: float64 . Let us view the distribution of power values in a histogram. . ax = sns.histplot( data = autos, x = &quot;power_ps&quot;, ) ax.set_title(&quot;Metric Horsepower (PS) of Used Cars&quot;) ax.grid(True) plt.show() . Like the price data, the power data are right-skewed. Lower values are more frequent. Still, we managed to capture most (274,514) of the datapoints using this range. . Year of Registration . Earlier, we noticed that the years of registration ranged from 1000 to 9999. . autos[&quot;year_reg&quot;].describe() . count 274514.000000 mean 2003.658039 std 29.529992 min 1000.000000 25% 1999.000000 50% 2004.000000 75% 2007.000000 max 9999.000000 Name: year_reg, dtype: float64 . Logically, the years of registration should only range from when automobiles were first mass-produced, in the 1800s or 1900s (Encyclopedia Britannica), to the year when the ads were last seen by the web crawler. . We can know when the ads were last seen using the last_seen column of the dataset. The dates are shown as strings with years first, so we can sort them in descending order to find the most recent date. . autos[&quot;last_seen&quot;].sort_values(ascending = False) . 343211 2016-04-07 14:58:51 5069 2016-04-07 14:58:50 72231 2016-04-07 14:58:50 62402 2016-04-07 14:58:50 122068 2016-04-07 14:58:50 ... 244077 2016-03-05 14:35:28 177326 2016-03-05 14:25:59 136842 2016-03-05 14:15:39 275196 2016-03-05 14:15:16 311225 2016-03-05 14:15:08 Name: last_seen, Length: 274514, dtype: object . It looks like all of the ads were last seen in 2016, so the cars could not have been registered beyond that year. . Therefore, a reasonable range of years would be from 1900 to 2016. Let us keep all rows within this range. . autos = autos.loc[autos[&quot;year_reg&quot;].between(1900, 2016)] autos[&quot;year_reg&quot;].describe() . count 264977.000000 mean 2002.977877 std 6.097207 min 1910.000000 25% 1999.000000 50% 2003.000000 75% 2007.000000 max 2016.000000 Name: year_reg, dtype: float64 . Now, the years of registration range from 1910 to 2016. There are also 264,977 datapoints remaining. . Months of Registration . Lastly, we noticed that the months of registration included integers from 0 to 12, not 1 to 12. Let us make a discrete histogram in order to understand the distribution. . ax = sns.histplot( data = autos, x = &quot;month_reg&quot;, discrete = True, ) ax.set_title(&quot;Used Cars&#39; Months of Registration&quot;) ax.grid(True) plt.show() . The graph above shows that 0 is the least frequent value, appearing under 15,000 times. It seems very likely that it is a placeholder for unknown months. Therefore, we can remove rows with month 0. . autos = autos.loc[autos[&quot;month_reg&quot;] &gt;= 1] autos[&quot;month_reg&quot;].describe() . count 251198.000000 mean 6.396237 std 3.346424 min 1.000000 25% 4.000000 50% 6.000000 75% 9.000000 max 12.000000 Name: month_reg, dtype: float64 . Missing Values . Now, we shall deal with the null values in the dataset. First, how many null values are there per column? . autos.isnull().sum() . date_crawled 0 name 0 price 0 abtest 0 vehicle_type 5871 year_reg 0 gearbox 3103 power_ps 0 model 7422 mileage_km 0 month_reg 0 fuel_type 9057 brand 0 damage 28718 date_created 0 postal_code 0 last_seen 0 dtype: int64 . There are thousands of missing values for the vehicle type, gearbox, model, fuel type, and presence of damage. None of these can be easily determined from other columns. . If we were to remove all rows with these missing values, we would be left with: . autos.dropna().shape . (208538, 17) . We would have 208,538 rows left. This is just over half of the original number of datapoints we started with, 371,528. . This project is meant to showcase data cleaning, and we are assuming that all of the columns in the dataset will be used for analysis. Thus, we will have to delete all rows with missing values. . autos.dropna(inplace = True) . Below are the final descriptive statistics for the dataset after all of the cleaning. . autos.describe(include = &quot;all&quot;) . date_crawled name price abtest vehicle_type year_reg gearbox power_ps model mileage_km month_reg fuel_type brand damage date_created postal_code last_seen . count 208538 | 208538 | 208538.000000 | 208538 | 208538 | 208538.000000 | 208538 | 208538.000000 | 208538 | 208538.000000 | 208538.000000 | 208538 | 208538 | 208538 | 208538 | 208538.000000 | 208538 | . unique 177458 | 114616 | NaN | 2 | 8 | NaN | 2 | NaN | 248 | NaN | NaN | 7 | 39 | 2 | 98 | NaN | 116677 | . top 2016-03-31 16:50:28 | BMW_318i | NaN | test | limousine | NaN | manuell | NaN | golf | NaN | NaN | benzin | volkswagen | nein | 2016-04-03 00:00:00 | NaN | 2016-04-06 12:15:45 | . freq 5 | 616 | NaN | 108258 | 62894 | NaN | 166213 | NaN | 17505 | NaN | NaN | 136145 | 44157 | 189720 | 8271 | NaN | 14 | . mean NaN | NaN | 4984.662522 | NaN | NaN | 2003.205953 | NaN | 122.635031 | NaN | 128250.990227 | 6.381225 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 51907.756020 | NaN | . std NaN | NaN | 3990.028529 | NaN | NaN | 5.696916 | NaN | 50.515054 | NaN | 35781.848172 | 3.350349 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 25766.228717 | NaN | . min NaN | NaN | 500.000000 | NaN | NaN | 1937.000000 | NaN | 50.000000 | NaN | 5000.000000 | 1.000000 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 1067.000000 | NaN | . 25% NaN | NaN | 1749.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2000.000000 | NaN | 85.000000 | NaN | 125000.000000 | 3.000000 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 31319.000000 | NaN | . 50% NaN | NaN | 3750.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2004.000000 | NaN | 116.000000 | NaN | 150000.000000 | 6.000000 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 51371.000000 | NaN | . 75% NaN | NaN | 7300.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2007.000000 | NaN | 150.000000 | NaN | 150000.000000 | 9.000000 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 72649.000000 | NaN | . max NaN | NaN | 16270.000000 | NaN | NaN | 2016.000000 | NaN | 450.000000 | NaN | 150000.000000 | 12.000000 | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | 99998.000000 | NaN | . Data Transformation . Strings to Datetime Objects . As we saw earlier, the date_crawled, date_created, and last_seen columns contain dates and times in string format. It would be better to store these as datetime objects so that each part (year, month, etc.) can be accessed in analysis. . For this section, I used &quot;Convert the column type from string to datetime format in Pandas dataframe&quot; (2020) as a reference. . First, though, we have to make a format string so that the numbers can be parsed properly. . autos[[&quot;date_crawled&quot;, &quot;date_created&quot;, &quot;last_seen&quot;]].head() . date_crawled date_created last_seen . 3 2016-03-17 16:54:04 | 2016-03-17 00:00:00 | 2016-03-17 17:40:17 | . 4 2016-03-31 17:25:20 | 2016-03-31 00:00:00 | 2016-04-06 10:17:21 | . 5 2016-04-04 17:36:23 | 2016-04-04 00:00:00 | 2016-04-06 19:17:07 | . 6 2016-04-01 20:48:51 | 2016-04-01 00:00:00 | 2016-04-05 18:18:39 | . 10 2016-03-26 19:54:18 | 2016-03-26 00:00:00 | 2016-04-06 10:45:34 | . All 3 columns seem to follow the same format: . {4 digit year}-{2 digit month}-{2 digit day} {24-hour time hour}:{minute}:{second} . The equivalent format string is below. . format_str = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot; . We can use this string to parse the dates. This can be done quickly by using the pd.to_datetime() vectorized function, instead of using a for-loop with the datetime module. . autos[&quot;date_crawled&quot;] = pd.to_datetime( autos[&quot;date_crawled&quot;], format = format_str, ) autos[&quot;date_crawled&quot;] . 3 2016-03-17 16:54:04 4 2016-03-31 17:25:20 5 2016-04-04 17:36:23 6 2016-04-01 20:48:51 10 2016-03-26 19:54:18 ... 371516 2016-04-04 09:57:12 371517 2016-03-28 13:48:07 371520 2016-03-19 19:53:49 371524 2016-03-05 19:56:21 371525 2016-03-19 18:57:12 Name: date_crawled, Length: 208538, dtype: datetime64[ns] . We can see that the values look similar to how they looked before, but the dtype is now datetime64[ns]. . For example, we can now access the month and day from the datetime objects. . autos[&quot;date_crawled&quot;].iloc[0].month . 3 . autos[&quot;date_crawled&quot;].iloc[0].day . 17 . We can see that the date in the first row has a month of 3 (March) and a day of 17. . Let us do the same for the other 2 date columns. . autos[&quot;date_created&quot;] = pd.to_datetime( autos[&quot;date_created&quot;], format = format_str, ) autos[&quot;last_seen&quot;] = pd.to_datetime( autos[&quot;last_seen&quot;], format = format_str, ) autos[[&quot;date_crawled&quot;, &quot;date_created&quot;, &quot;last_seen&quot;]].describe( datetime_is_numeric = True, ) . date_crawled date_created last_seen . count 208538 | 208538 | 208538 | . mean 2016-03-21 13:39:21.839721984 | 2016-03-20 19:44:12.604321536 | 2016-03-30 09:43:36.598633984 | . min 2016-03-05 14:06:23 | 2015-08-07 00:00:00 | 2016-03-05 14:15:16 | . 25% 2016-03-13 11:06:28 | 2016-03-13 00:00:00 | 2016-03-23 20:52:41.500000 | . 50% 2016-03-21 18:46:44.500000 | 2016-03-21 00:00:00 | 2016-04-04 14:39:49.500000 | . 75% 2016-03-29 15:36:22.500000 | 2016-03-29 00:00:00 | 2016-04-06 11:45:07 | . max 2016-04-07 14:36:58 | 2016-04-07 00:00:00 | 2016-04-07 14:58:51 | . We can see that since the 3 columns are in datetime format, they are now treated as numerical values. They have a mean and a list of percentiles. . Data transformation is done, so we can move on to data analysis. . Data Analysis . Statistical analyses with hypothesis testing are outside of the scope of this project, since it is centered on data cleaning. Thus, I will perform some simple aggregates and visualize them in graphs. . Most Expensive Car Brands . Below, a bar graph shows each car brand and the median price. The mean is not used because we know that the price data are right-skewed, not normal. . plt.figure(figsize = (14, 5)) ax = sns.barplot( data = autos, x = &quot;brand&quot;, y = &quot;price&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Median Prices of Used Cars by Brand&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.xticks(rotation = 90) plt.show() . The graph shows that Porsche has the highest median price of used cars, at almost 12,000 euros. This is followed by Mini, Land Rover, and Jeep. . Used Car Prices by Age . The line plot below shows the relationship between a car&#39;s year of registration (later -&gt; newer) and the median price. . plt.figure(figsize = (14, 5)) ax = sns.lineplot( data = autos, x = &quot;year_reg&quot;, y = &quot;price&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Median Prices of Used Cars by Year of Registration&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.xticks(rotation = 90) plt.show() . The line plot shows that used car prices are lowest when the year of registration is in the mid-1990s. . To the right of the minimum, as the year of registration gets later, the median price steadily becomes higher. This makes sense because newer cars would have a higher value, even if they&#39;re used. . On the other hand, to the left of the minimum, the median price increases (albeit erratically) as the year of registration gets earlier. This suggests that very old cars are considered to be valuable because they are rare. It is likely that the avid car collectors are the ones who pay such high prices for these cars. . Used Car Prices by Mileage . The line plot below shows the relationship between used cars&#39; mileage in kilometers and the median price. . plt.figure(figsize = (14, 5)) ax = sns.lineplot( data = autos, x = &quot;mileage_km&quot;, y = &quot;price&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Median Prices of Used Cars by Mileage in Kilometers&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.xticks(rotation = 90) plt.show() . As expected, price decreases as mileage increases. What is unexpected is that there is a sharp increase in price from around 500 km to 1000 km. This was likely caused by an outlier datapoint which had a low mileage and a low price. . Effect of Presence of Damage on Used Car Price . Lastly, we will analyze the effect of the presence of unrepaired damage on the median price of used cars. . ax = sns.barplot( data = autos, x = &quot;damage&quot;, y = &quot;price&quot;, estimator = np.median, ci = None, ) plt.title(&quot;Effect of Presence of Damage on Median Used Car Price&quot;) plt.grid(True) plt.xticks(rotation = 90) plt.show() . It can be seen that the median price of used cars without damage is 4000 euros. The median price is 1500 euros for those with unrepaired damage. . Therefore, cars with damage generally have lower prices. This makes sense because if the buyer plans to drive the car, they must shoulder the expense of repairing it. . Conclusion . In this project, we did cleaning, transformation, and simple analyses on data about used cars. Below are the insights we gained with regards to each research question. Note that prices were aggregated using the median, not the mean. . Which brands of the used cars are most expensive? | . The top 4 most expensive brands of used cars are Porsche, Mini, Land Rover, and Jeep (descending order). . . Does a used car&#39;s age affect its price? | . Yes. Cars registered in the mid-1990s have the lowest prices, with a median of 1000 euros. . As cars get newer from that point, their median price increases. As cars get older from the same point, their median price also increases. Very old cars are rare and therefore valuable to collectors. . . Does a used car&#39;s mileage affect its price? | . Yes, as mileage increases, price decreases. . . Does the presence of unrepaired damage affect a car&#39;s price? | . Yes, the median price of damaged used cars is much lower than that of cars without damage. . . . Thanks for reading! .",

            "content": ". Unsplash | Clint Patterson Overview . Hacker News is a popular website about technology. Specifically, it is a community choice aggregator of tech content. Users can: . Submit tech articles that the user found online. | Submit &quot;Ask&quot; posts to ask the community a question. | Submit &quot;Show&quot; posts to show the community something that the user made. | Vote and comment on other people&#39;s posts. | . In this project, we will analyze and compare Ask posts and Show posts in order to answer the following questions: . Between Ask posts and Show posts, which type receives more comments in terms of average number of comments per post? | Can posting at a certain time of day result in getting more comments? | . This analysis can be helpful for Hacker News users who would like for their posts to reach a larger audience on the platform. . Note: I wrote this notebook for the Dataquest course&#8217;s Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts. The research questions and general project flow came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. . Package Installs . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import altair as alt import datetime as dt . Dataset . The dataset for this project is the Hacker News Posts dataset on Kaggle, uploaded by Hacker News. . The following is quoted from the dataset&#39;s Description. . This data set is Hacker News posts from the last 12 months (up to September 26 2016). . It includes the following columns: . title: title of the post (self explanatory) | url: the url of the item being linked to | num_points: the number of upvotes the post received | num_comments: the number of comments the post received | author: the name of the account that made the post | created_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US) | . Let us view the first 5 rows of the dataset below. . hn = pd.read_csv(&quot;./2021-05-11-OHNP-Files/HN_posts_year_to_Sep_26_2016.csv&quot;) hn.head() . id title url num_points num_comments author created_at . 0 12579008 | You have two days to comment if you want stem ... | http://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2015... | 1 | 0 | altstar | 9/26/2016 3:26 | . 1 12579005 | SQLAR the SQLite Archiver | https://www.sqlite.org/sqlar/doc/trunk/README.md | 1 | 0 | blacksqr | 9/26/2016 3:24 | . 2 12578997 | What if we just printed a flatscreen televisio... | https://medium.com/vanmoof/our-secrets-out-f21... | 1 | 0 | pavel_lishin | 9/26/2016 3:19 | . 3 12578989 | algorithmic music | http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/7/109891-al... | 1 | 0 | poindontcare | 9/26/2016 3:16 | . 4 12578979 | How the Data Vault Enables the Next-Gen Data W... | https://www.talend.com/blog/2016/05/12/talend-... | 1 | 0 | markgainor1 | 9/26/2016 3:14 | . Below is the shape of the dataset. . print(hn.shape) . (293119, 7) . There are 293,119 rows and 7 columns in the dataset. . Before the data can be analyzed, it must first be cleaned. . Data Cleaning . Duplicate Rows . Below, I use pandas to delete duplicate rows except for the first instance of each duplicate. . Rows will be considered as duplicates if they are exactly alike in all features. I decided on this because it is possible for two posts to have the same title and/or url but be posted at different times or by different users. Thus, we cannot identify duplicates based on one or two features alone. . hn = hn.drop_duplicates(keep = &quot;first&quot;) print(hn.shape) . (293119, 7) . No duplicates were found. All rows were kept. . Posts without Comments . Our research questions involve the number of comments on each post. However, there are many posts with 0 comments. . To illustrate this, below a frequency table of the number of comments on each post. . def freq_comments(df = hn): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function to make a frequency table of the number of comments per post specifically for the Hacker News dataset.&quot;&quot;&quot; freq_df = df[&quot;num_comments&quot;].value_counts().reset_index() freq_df.columns = [&quot;num_comments&quot;, &quot;frequency&quot;] freq_df = freq_df.sort_values( by = &quot;num_comments&quot;, ).reset_index( drop = True, ) return freq_df freq_df1 = freq_comments() freq_df1 . num_comments frequency . 0 0 | 212718 | . 1 1 | 28055 | . 2 2 | 9731 | . 3 3 | 5016 | . 4 4 | 3272 | . ... ... | ... | . 543 1007 | 1 | . 544 1120 | 1 | . 545 1448 | 1 | . 546 1733 | 1 | . 547 2531 | 1 | . 548 rows × 2 columns . The table above shows that posts with 0 comments are most frequent. . Let us plot the table on a histogram. . def hist_comments(df, title): &quot;&quot;&quot;Function to make a histogram of the number of comments per post specifically for the Hacker News dataset.&quot;&quot;&quot; chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode( x = alt.X( &quot;num_comments:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Number of Comments&quot;, bin = alt.Bin(step = 1) ), y = alt.Y( &quot;frequency:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Frequency&quot;, ), ).properties( title = title, width = 700, height = 400, ) return chart hist_comments(freq_df1, &quot;Histogram of Number of Comments per Post&quot;) . There are so many posts with 0 comments that we cannot see the histogram bins for other numbers of comments. . Considering that the dataset is large and most rows have 0 comments, it would be best to drop all rows with 0 comments. This would make analysis less computationally expensive and allow us to answer our research questions. . with_comments = hn[&quot;num_comments&quot;] &gt; 0 hn = hn.loc[with_comments].reset_index(drop = True) print(hn.shape) . (80401, 7) . Now, the dataset is left with only 80,401 rows. This will be easier to work with. . Below is the new histogram. . freq_df2 = freq_comments() hist_comments(freq_df2, &quot;Histogram of Number of Comments per Post&quot;) . The distribution is still heavily right-skewed since many posts have very few comments. What&#39;s important is that unnecessary data has been removed. . Missing Values . Finally, let us remove rows with missing values. In order to answer our research questions, we only need the following columns: . title | num_comments | created_at | . Thus, we will delete rows with missing values in this column. . hn.dropna( subset = [&quot;title&quot;, &quot;num_comments&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;], inplace = True, ) print(hn.shape) . (80401, 7) . The number of rows did not change from 80401. Therefore, no missing values were found in these columns, and no rows were dropped. . Data cleaning is now done. . Filtering Posts . As mentioned earlier, the first research question involves comparing Ask posts to Show posts. In order to do this, we have to group the posts into three types: . Ask Posts | Show Posts | Other Posts | . Other posts are usually posts that share a tech article found online. . Ask and Show posts can be identified using the start of the post title. Ask posts start with &quot;Ask HN: &quot;. . ask_mask = [index for index, value in hn[&quot;title&quot;].iteritems() if value.startswith(&quot;Ask HN: &quot;) ] hn.loc[ask_mask].head() . id title url num_points num_comments author created_at . 1 12578908 | Ask HN: What TLD do you use for local developm... | NaN | 4 | 7 | Sevrene | 9/26/2016 2:53 | . 6 12578522 | Ask HN: How do you pass on your work when you ... | NaN | 6 | 3 | PascLeRasc | 9/26/2016 1:17 | . 18 12577870 | Ask HN: Why join a fund when you can be an angel? | NaN | 1 | 3 | anthony_james | 9/25/2016 22:48 | . 27 12577647 | Ask HN: Someone uses stock trading as passive ... | NaN | 5 | 2 | 00taffe | 9/25/2016 21:50 | . 41 12576946 | Ask HN: How hard would it be to make a cheap, ... | NaN | 2 | 1 | hkt | 9/25/2016 19:30 | . On the other hand, Show posts start with &quot;Show HN: &quot;. . show_mask = [index for index, value in hn[&quot;title&quot;].iteritems() if value.startswith(&quot;Show HN: &quot;) ] hn.loc[show_mask].head() . id title url num_points num_comments author created_at . 35 12577142 | Show HN: Jumble Essays on the go #PaulInYourP... | https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jumble-find-st... | 1 | 1 | ryderj | 9/25/2016 20:06 | . 43 12576813 | Show HN: Learn Japanese Vocab via multiple cho... | http://japanese.vul.io/ | 1 | 1 | soulchild37 | 9/25/2016 19:06 | . 52 12576090 | Show HN: Markov chain Twitter bot.

Other posts do not start with any special label. . Below, I create a new column &quot;post_type&quot; and assign the appropriate value to each row. . hn[&quot;post_type&quot;] = &quot;Other&quot; hn.loc[ask_mask, &quot;post_type&quot;] = &quot;Ask&quot; hn.loc[show_mask, &quot;post_type&quot;] = &quot;Show&quot; hn[[&quot;title&quot;, &quot;post_type&quot;]] . title post_type . 0 Saving the Hassle of Shopping | Other | . 1 Ask HN: What TLD do you use for local developm... | Ask | . 2 Amazons Algorithms Dont Find You the Best Deals | Other | . 3 Emergency dose of epinephrine that does not co... | Other | . 4 Phone Makers Could Cut Off Drivers.

Each row has now been labeled as a type of post. . Research Question 1: Comparing Ask and Show Posts . The first research question is, &quot;Between Ask posts and Show posts, which type receives more comments in terms of average number of comments per post?&quot; . Note that the data is not normally distributed; it is right-skewed. For example, here is the distribution of the number of comments per Ask post. . ask_freq = freq_comments( df = hn.loc[hn[&quot;post_type&quot;] == &quot;Ask&quot;] ) ask_freq . num_comments frequency . 0 1 | 1383 | . 1 2 | 1238 | . 2 3 | 762 | . 3 4 | 592 | . 4 5 | 373 | . ... ... | ... | . 203 898 | 1 | . 204 910 | 1 | . 205 937 | 1 | . 206 947 | 1 | . 207 1007 | 1 | . 208 rows × 2 columns . hist_comments( ask_freq, &quot;Histogram of Number of Comments per Ask Post&quot; ) . The histogram is similar for Show posts. . show_freq = freq_comments( df = hn.loc[hn[&quot;post_type&quot;] == &quot;Show&quot;], ) show_freq . num_comments frequency . 0 1 | 1738 | . 1 2 | 814 | . 2 3 | 504 | . 3 4 | 300 | . 4 5 | 196 | . ... ... | ... | . 137 250 | 1 | . 138 257 | 1 | . 139 280 | 1 | . 140 298 | 1 | . 141 306 | 1 | . 142 rows × 2 columns . hist_comments( show_freq, &quot;Histogram of Number of Comments per Show Post&quot; ) . Therefore, the mean would not be a good measure of central tendency for the &quot;average number of comments per post.&quot; Thus, we will use the median instead. . dct = {&quot;Ask&quot;: None, &quot;Show&quot;: None} for key in dct: median = np.median( hn[&quot;num_comments&quot;].loc[hn[&quot;post_type&quot;] == key] ) dct[key] = median table = pd.DataFrame.from_dict( dct, orient = &quot;index&quot;, ).reset_index( ).rename(columns = { &quot;index&quot;: &quot;post_type&quot;, 0: &quot;median_comments&quot;, }) chart = alt.Chart(table).mark_bar().encode( y = alt.Y(&quot;post_type:N&quot;, title = &quot;Post Type&quot;), x = alt.X(&quot;median_comments:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Median Number of Comments per Post&quot;), ).properties( title = &quot;Median Number of Comments for the Two Post Types&quot;, ) chart . The bar graph shows that Ask posts have a higher median number of comments per post, compared to Show posts. . Important: The results suggest that Ask posts get more comments than Show posts. It may be easier for users to reach a larger audience via Ask posts. . Research Question 2: Active Times . The second research question is, &quot;Can posting at a certain time of day result in getting more comments?&quot; . For this part of the analysis, we will only be using Ask post data for simplicity. . We will divide the day into 24 one-hour periods, and then calculate the number of Ask posts created in each period. . String Template for Time . Before analying, we need to inspect the &quot;created_at&quot; column of the dataset. . hn_ask = hn.loc[ hn[&quot;post_type&quot;] == &quot;Ask&quot; ].reset_index( drop = True, ) hn_ask[[&quot;created_at&quot;]].head() . created_at . 0 9/26/2016 2:53 | . 1 9/26/2016 1:17 | . 2 9/25/2016 22:48 | . 3 9/25/2016 21:50 | . 4 9/25/2016 19:30 | . The strings in this column appear to follow the following format: . month/day/year hour:minute . With the datetime module, the following is the equivalent formatting template. . template = &quot;%m/%d/%Y %H:%M&quot; . Parsing Times . The time data can now be parsed and used for analysis. . hn_ask[&quot;created_at&quot;] = pd.to_datetime( hn_ask[&quot;created_at&quot;], format = template, ) hn_ask[&quot;created_at&quot;].head() . 0 2016-09-26 02:53:00 1 2016-09-26 01:17:00 2 2016-09-25 22:48:00 3 2016-09-25 21:50:00 4 2016-09-25 19:30:00 Name: created_at, dtype: datetime64[ns] . The column is now in datetime format. . With this data, we will make 2 dictionaries. The hours_posts dictionary will count the number of posts at certain hours. The hours_comments dictionary will count the number of comments received by posts made at certain hours. . hours_posts = {} hours_comments = {} for index, row in hn_ask.iterrows(): date_dt = row[&quot;created_at&quot;] num_comments = row[&quot;num_comments&quot;] # extract hour hour = date_dt.hour # update dictionaries hours_posts.setdefault(hour, 0) hours_posts[hour] += 1 hours_comments.setdefault(hour, 0) hours_comments[hour] += num_comments . The hours were parsed and mapped to their respective counts of posts and comments. . The code below transforms the dictionaries into DataFrames for ease of use. . def hour_to_df(dct, data_label): &quot;&quot;&quot;Make a DataFrame from a dictionary that maps an &#39;hour&#39; column to another column, named by `data_label`.&quot;&quot;&quot; result = pd.DataFrame.from_dict( dct, orient = &quot;index&quot;, ).reset_index( ).rename(columns = { &quot;index&quot;: &quot;hour&quot;, 0: data_label, }).sort_values( by = &quot;hour&quot;, ).reset_index( drop = True, ) return result hours_posts_df = hour_to_df( hours_posts, data_label = &quot;num_posts&quot;, ) hours_comments_df = hour_to_df( hours_comments, data_label = &quot;num_comments&quot;, ) hours_posts_df.head() . hour num_posts . 0 0 | 228 | . 1 1 | 222 | . 2 2 | 227 | . 3 3 | 210 | . 4 4 | 184 | . hours_comments_df.head() . hour num_comments . 0 0 | 2261 | . 1 1 | 2068 | . 2 2 | 2996 | . 3 3 | 2152 | . 4 4 | 2353 | . The hours have been parsed, and the tables have been generated. . Additionally, another DataFrame is created below. It calculates the median number of comments per post by the hour posted. . hn_ask[&quot;hour&quot;] = hn_ask[&quot;created_at&quot;].dt.hour hours_median = hn_ask.pivot_table( index = &quot;hour&quot;, values = &quot;num_comments&quot;, aggfunc = np.median, ).reset_index() hours_median . hour num_comments . 0 0 | 3.0 | . 1 1 | 3.0 | . 2 2 | 4.0 | . 3 3 | 3.0 | . 4 4 | 4.0 | . 5 5 | 3.0 | . 6 6 | 3.0 | . 7 7 | 4.0 | . 8 8 | 3.5 | . 9 9 | 3.0 | . 10 10 | 4.0 | . 11 11 | 4.0 | . 12 12 | 4.0 | . 13 13 | 4.0 | . 14 14 | 3.0 | . 15 15 | 4.0 | . 16 16 | 3.0 | . 17 17 | 4.0 | . 18 18 | 3.0 | . 19 19 | 3.0 | . 20 20 | 4.0 | . 21 21 | 3.0 | . 22 22 | 4.0 | . 23 23 | 4.0 | . Number of Posts by Hour of the Day . Below is a table showing the total number of posts that were created, grouped by hour of the day. . hours_posts_df . hour num_posts . 0 0 | 228 | . 1 1 | 222 | . 2 2 | 227 | . 3 3 | 210 | . 4 4 | 184 | . 5 5 | 165 | . 6 6 | 176 | . 7 7 | 156 | . 8 8 | 190 | . 9 9 | 176 | . 10 10 | 218 | . 11 11 | 250 | . 12 12 | 272 | . 13 13 | 323 | . 14 14 | 377 | . 15 15 | 467 | . 16 16 | 412 | . 17 17 | 402 | . 18 18 | 450 | . 19 19 | 418 | . 20 20 | 392 | . 21 21 | 407 | . 22 22 | 286 | . 23 23 | 276 | . This table is in 24-hour time. Hour 13 refers to 1:00 PM. The table shows how many posts are made for every hour in the day. . Below is a line chart that shows this visually. . chart = alt.Chart(hours_posts_df).mark_line().encode( x = alt.X( &quot;hour:O&quot;, title = &quot;Hour of the Day&quot;, axis = alt.Axis(labelAngle = 0) ), y = alt.Y(&quot;num_posts:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Number of Posts&quot;), ).properties( title = &quot;Number of Posts by Hour of the Day&quot;, width = 700, height = 400, ).configure_axis( grid = True, ) chart . The histogram clearly shows that Hacker News users most actively make posts between 15:00 and 18:00, or from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. . The most active hour for posting is 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM. . Number of Comments by Hour Posted . Next, a similar analysis is done for the total number of comments written by Hacker News users, grouped by the hour that the original posts were created. Below is the table for this data. . hours_comments_df . hour num_comments . 0 0 | 2261 | . 1 1 | 2068 | . 2 2 | 2996 | . 3 3 | 2152 | . 4 4 | 2353 | . 5 5 | 1838 | . 6 6 | 1587 | . 7 7 | 1584 | . 8 8 | 2362 | . 9 9 | 1477 | . 10 10 | 3011 | . 11 11 | 2794 | . 12 12 | 4226 | . 13 13 | 7219 | . 14 14 | 4970 | . 15 15 | 18525 | . 16 16 | 4458 | . 17 17 | 5536 | . 18 18 | 4824 | . 19 19 | 3949 | . 20 20 | 4462 | . 21 21 | 4500 | . 22 22 | 3369 | . 23 23 | 2297 | . Below is the line chart that visualizes the table. . chart = alt.Chart(hours_comments_df).mark_line().encode( x = alt.X( &quot;hour:O&quot;, title = &quot;Hour of the Day&quot;, axis = alt.Axis(labelAngle = 0) ), y = alt.Y(&quot;num_comments:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Number of Comments&quot;), ).properties( title = &quot;Number of Comments by Hour Posted&quot;, width = 700, height = 400, ).configure_axis( grid = True, ) chart . The line chart shows that many comments are made on posts created from 13:00 to 17:00, or 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM. . Notably, there was a total of over 18,000 comments on posts created at 3:00 PM. This may suggest that Hacker News users most actively comment at around this time. . However, there is also the possibility that this total was influenced by a few outliers. Let&#39;s check the distribution of the number of comments made at 3:00 PM. . alt.Chart( hn_ask.loc[hn_ask[&quot;hour&quot;] == 15] ).mark_bar().encode( x = alt.X(&quot;num_comments:Q&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;count()&quot;) ).properties( title = &quot;Distribution of Number of Comments per Post (3:00 PM)&quot;, width = 700, height = 200, ).configure_axis( grid = True, ) . Indeed, there are several outlier posts with a very high number of comments, going up to 1000. These influenced the spike in the line chart. . Therefore, we can&#39;t say that a post will definitely get many comments if it is posted at 3:00 PM. However, we can say that generally a lot of comments are made in the afternoon from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. . Median Number of Comments per Post, by Hour Posted . The table below shows the median number of comments per post, by the hour of posting. . hours_median . hour num_comments . 0 0 | 3.0 | . 1 1 | 3.0 | . 2 2 | 4.0 | . 3 3 | 3.0 | . 4 4 | 4.0 | . 5 5 | 3.0 | . 6 6 | 3.0 | . 7 7 | 4.0 | . 8 8 | 3.5 | . 9 9 | 3.0 | . 10 10 | 4.0 | . 11 11 | 4.0 | . 12 12 | 4.0 | . 13 13 | 4.0 | . 14 14 | 3.0 | . 15 15 | 4.0 | . 16 16 | 3.0 | . 17 17 | 4.0 | . 18 18 | 3.0 | . 19 19 | 3.0 | . 20 20 | 4.0 | . 21 21 | 3.0 | . 22 22 | 4.0 | . 23 23 | 4.0 | . This is visualized in the line chart below, which looks quite different from the previous two charts. . chart = alt.Chart(hours_median).mark_line().encode( x = alt.X( &quot;hour:O&quot;, title = &quot;Hour of the Day&quot;, axis = alt.Axis(labelAngle = 0) ), y = alt.Y(&quot;num_comments:Q&quot;, title = &quot;Median Number of Comments per Post&quot;), ).properties( title = &quot;Median Number of Comments per Post, by Hour Posted&quot;, width = 700, height = 400, ).configure_axis( grid = True, ) chart . This graph shows that the median number of comments per post is very consistent throughout the day. It ranges from 3 comments to 4 comments. . This brings us a new question. We&#39;ve seen that Hacker News users most actively post and comment in the afternoon. So, why does the median number of comments per post not increase in the afternoon? . A possible explanation is that since the site is oversaturated with new posts in the afternoon, only the very best posts receive attention. The rest are lost in the flood of new posts. . Conclusion . In this project, we analyzed data about Hacker News posts, specifically regarding the number of comments that they receive. Below are the research questions, and the best answers that we could come up with from our analysis. . . Between Ask posts and Show posts, which type receives more comments in terms of average number of comments per post? | . Ask posts receive a higher median number of comments per post, compared to Show posts. In order to reach a wider audience or converse with more users, it is better to make an Ask post. . . Can posting at a certain time of day result in getting more comments? | . Hacker News users are very active in the afternoon, from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. However, if you post in the afternoon, your post may get lost in the flood of new posts. Hypothetically, it may be better to post in the morning, like at 7:00 AM, so that some people can notice your post. Then, your post can get more attention in the afternoon. . .

            "content": ". Unsplash | Alexander Shatov Overview . Welcome. In this project, we will be working on data about different types of apps and their corresponding number of users. The goal is to determine which apps can best attract the largest number of users. This will help a hypothetical app company make decisions regarding what apps to develop in the near future. . Note: I wrote this notebook for the Dataquest course&#8217;s Guided Project: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets. The hypothetical app company and the general project flow came from Dataquest. However, all of the text and code here are written by me unless stated otherwise. . App Company&#39;s Context . First, we must know the context of the hypothetical app company so that we can align our analysis with it. . This company only makes free apps directed toward an English-speaking audience. They get revenue from in-app advertisements and purchases. Thus, they rely on having a large number of users so that they can generate more revenue. . Additionally, their apps should ideally be successful on both Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The reason is that the company has the following 3-step validation strategy: . (from the Dataquest guided project) . Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play. | If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further. | If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store. | We&#39;ll take this information into consideration throughout our analysis. . Package Installs . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import altair as alt import re . App Data Overview . This project uses two datasets. . The Google Play Store dataset lists over 10,000 Android apps. | The Apple App Store dataset lists over 7,000 iOS apps. | . data_apple = pd.read_csv(&quot;./2021-05-08-PAP-Files/AppleStore.csv&quot;, header = 0) data_google = pd.read_csv(&quot;./2021-05-08-PAP-Files/googleplaystore.csv&quot;, header = 0) . Apple App Store dataset . print(data_apple.shape) . (7197, 16) . The dataset has 7197 rows (1 row per app), and 16 columns which describe these apps. . According to the Kaggle documentation (Mobile App Store ( 7200 apps)), the following are the columns and their meanings. . &quot;id&quot; : App ID | &quot;track_name&quot;: App Name | &quot;size_bytes&quot;: Size (in Bytes) | &quot;currency&quot;: Currency Type | &quot;price&quot;: Price amount | &quot;ratingcounttot&quot;: User Rating counts (for all version) | &quot;ratingcountver&quot;: User Rating counts (for current version) | &quot;user_rating&quot; : Average User Rating value (for all version) | &quot;userratingver&quot;: Average User Rating value (for current version) | &quot;ver&quot; : Latest version code | &quot;cont_rating&quot;: Content Rating | &quot;prime_genre&quot;: Primary Genre | &quot;sup_devices.num&quot;: Number of supporting devices | &quot;ipadSc_urls.num&quot;: Number of screenshots showed for display | &quot;lang.num&quot;: Number of supported languages | &quot;vpp_lic&quot;: Vpp Device Based Licensing Enabled | .

Looking closely, we can see that duplicate rows are not exactly identical. The &quot;Reviews&quot; column, which shows the total number of reviews of the app, has different values. . It can be inferred that the row with the largest value is the newest entry for the app. Therefore, all duplicate rows will be dropped except for the ones with the largest &quot;Reviews&quot; values. . def remove_duplicates(df, name_col, reviews_col): # Each key-value pair will follow the format: # {&quot;App Name&quot;: maximum number of reviews among all duplicates} reviews_max = {} for index, row in df.iterrows(): name = row[name_col] n_reviews = int(row[reviews_col]) if n_reviews &gt; reviews_max.get(name, -1): reviews_max[name] = n_reviews # List of duplicate indices to drop, # excluding the row with the highest number of reviews # among that app&#39;s duplicate rows. indices_to_drop = [] # Rows with names that have already been added into this list # will be dropped. already_added = [] for index, row in df.iterrows(): name = row[name_col] n_reviews = int(row[reviews_col]) if (name not in already_added) and (n_reviews == reviews_max[name]): already_added.append(name) else: indices_to_drop.append(index) # Remove duplicates and return the clean dataset. clean = df.drop(indices_to_drop) return clean android_clean = remove_duplicates(data_google, &quot;App&quot;, &quot;Reviews&quot;) print(android_clean.shape) .

The &quot;rating_count_tot&quot; column in the Apple App Store dataset is like the &quot;Reviews&quot; column in the Google Play dataset. It tells the total number of reviews so far. Therefore, Apple App Store dataset duplicates can be removed by keeping the rows with the highest rating count totals. . ios_clean = remove_duplicates(data_apple, &quot;track_name&quot;, &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;) print(ios_clean.shape) . (7195, 16) . From 7197 rows, there are now 7195 rows in the Apple App Store dataset. . Non-English Apps . The hypothetical app company who will use this analysis is a company that only makes apps in English. Thus, all apps with non-English titles shall be removed from the datasets. . The task now is to identify titles which are not in English. It is known that in the ASCII table, the characters most commonly used in English are within codes 0 to 127. Some English app titles may have special characters or emojis, though, so I will only remove titles which have more than 3 characters outside of the normal range. . def is_english(text): unicode = [ord(char) for char in text] normal = [(code &gt;= 0 and code &lt;= 127) for code in unicode] non_english = len(text) - sum(normal) return non_english &lt;= 3 def keep_english(df, name_col): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a new DataFrame containing only rows with English names.&quot;&quot;&quot; remove_indices = [] for index, row in df.iterrows(): name = row[name_col] if not is_english(name): remove_indices.append(index) return df.drop(remove_indices) android_clean = keep_english(android_clean, &quot;App&quot;) ios_clean = keep_english(ios_clean, &quot;track_name&quot;) print(&quot;Google Play Store Dataset:&quot;, android_clean.shape) print(&quot;Apple App Store Dataset:&quot;, ios_clean.shape) . Google Play Store Dataset: (9614, 13) Apple App Store Dataset: (6181, 16) . Now, there are only English apps in both datasets. . Paid Apps . As mentioned earlier, the app company only makes free apps. Therefore, data on paid apps is irrelevant to this analysis. Paid apps shall be identified and removed from both datasets. . def remove_paid(df, price_col): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a new DataFrame without paid apps.&quot;&quot;&quot; remove_indices = [] for index, row in df.iterrows(): price = str(row[price_col]) # Keep characters that are numeric or periods. price = float(re.sub(&quot;[^0-9.]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, price)) if price != 0.0: remove_indices.append(index) return df.drop(remove_indices) android_clean = remove_paid(android_clean, &quot;Price&quot;) ios_clean = remove_paid(ios_clean, &quot;price&quot;) print(&quot;Google Play Store Dataset:&quot;, android_clean.shape) print(&quot;Apple App Store Dataset:&quot;, ios_clean.shape) . Google Play Store Dataset: (8864, 13) Apple App Store Dataset: (3220, 16) . The datasets were left with 8864 apps in Google Play and 3220 apps in the App Store. . Missing Data . Lastly, let us remove rows with missing data. Note that it would be wasteful to remove rows with missing data in columns that we will not inspect. Therefore, we will only remove rows with missing data in relevant columns. (Why these are relevant will be explained later.) These would be the following. . Google Play Store dataset . App | Category | Installs | Genres | . Apple App Store dataset . track_name | prime_genre | rating_count_tot | . I will now remove all rows with missing values in these columns. . android_clean.dropna( subset = [&quot;App&quot;, &quot;Category&quot;, &quot;Installs&quot;, &quot;Genres&quot;], inplace = True, ) ios_clean.dropna( subset = [&quot;track_name&quot;, &quot;prime_genre&quot;, &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;], inplace = True, ) print(&quot;Google Play Store Dataset:&quot;, android_clean.shape) print(&quot;Apple App Store Dataset:&quot;, ios_clean.shape) . Google Play Store Dataset: (8864, 13) Apple App Store Dataset: (3220, 16) . These are the same shapes as before. Therefore, there were no missing values in the relevant columns. No datapoints were removed at this step. . Data cleaning is done, so now we can move on to the analysis. . Common App Genres . Now that the data has been cleaned, let us find out which genres of apps are most common in both app markets. If an app genre is common, then there may be high demand for it among users. . Which columns in the datasets can give information about the app genres? . print(&quot;Google Play Store&quot;) android_clean.head() . Google Play Store .

For Google Play, some columns that seem relevant are &quot;Category&quot; and &quot;Genres&quot;. For the Apple App Store, the relevant column is &quot;prime_genre&quot;. . We can determine the most common genres by using frequency tables of the mentioned columns. . def freq_table(df, label): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a frequency table of the values in a column of a DataFrame.&quot;&quot;&quot; col = df[label] freq = {} for value in col: freq.setdefault(value, 0) freq[value] += 1 for key in freq: freq[key] /= len(df) / 100 freq_series = pd.Series(freq).sort_values(ascending = False) return freq_series def sr_to_df(sr, col_name = &quot;number&quot;, n_head = None): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a DataFrame by resetting the index of a Series.&quot;&quot;&quot; df = sr.rename(col_name).reset_index().rename(columns = {&quot;index&quot;:&quot;name&quot;}) if n_head is not None: df = df.head(n_head) return df google_categories = freq_table(android_clean, &quot;Category&quot;) google_genres = freq_table(android_clean, &quot;Genres&quot;) apple_genres = freq_table(ios_clean, &quot;prime_genre&quot;) . The frequency tables will be inspected in the sections below. Only the top positions in each table will be shown, for brevity. . Apple App Store: Prime Genres . First, the frequency table of Apple App Store prime genres shall be analyzed. Below, I have ordered the table by frequency, descending. I have also made bar graphs showing the top 10 positions in each frequency table. . sr_to_df(apple_genres, &quot;percentage&quot;, n_head = 5) . name percentage . 0 Games | 58.136646 | . 1 Entertainment | 7.888199 | . 2 Photo &amp; Video | 4.968944 | . 3 Education | 3.664596 | . 4 Social Networking | 3.291925 | . def bar_n(series, chart_title, ylabel, n = 10, perc = False): &quot;&quot;&quot;Takes a series and outputs a bar graph of the first n items.&quot;&quot;&quot; series.index.name = &quot;name&quot; df = series.rename(&quot;number&quot;).reset_index() df[&quot;number&quot;] = [round(i, 2) for i in df[&quot;number&quot;]] df = df[:n] bar = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode( x = alt.X(&quot;name&quot;, title = &quot;Name&quot;, sort = &quot;-y&quot;), y = alt.Y(&quot;number&quot;, title = ylabel), ) text = bar.mark_text( align = &#39;center&#39;, baseline = &#39;middle&#39;, dy = -5, # Nudge text upward ).encode( text = &#39;number:Q&#39; ) chart = (bar + text).properties( title = chart_title, width = 700, height = 400, ) return chart bar_n( apple_genres, &quot;Top 10 Most Common Prime Genres of iOS Apps&quot;, &quot;Percentage of Apps&quot;, perc = True, ) . The top 5 most common prime genres in the Apple App Store are Games, Entertainment, Photo &amp; Video, Education, and Social Networking. Games are at the top, occupying over 58% of all apps. This is a much higher percentage than any other single genre occupies. . Important: The general impression is that there are many more iOS apps that are entertainment-related apps compared to practical apps. . Google Play Store: Categories . Next, below is the frequency table for Google Play Store app categories. . sr_to_df(google_categories, &quot;percentage&quot;, 5) . name percentage . 0 FAMILY | 18.907942 | . 1 GAME | 9.724729 | . 2 TOOLS | 8.461191 | . 3 BUSINESS | 4.591606 | . 4 LIFESTYLE | 3.903430 | . bar_n( google_categories, &quot;Top 10 Most Common Categories of Android Apps&quot;, &quot;Percentage of Apps&quot;, perc = True, ) . The picture here seems to be different. The most common category is Family occupying almost 19% of all apps, followed by Game, Tools, Business, and Lifestyle. . Important: The table suggests that practical app categories are more common in Google Play than in the Apple App Store. . Google Play Store: Genres . Lastly, below is the frequency table for Google Play Store app genres. . sr_to_df(google_genres, &quot;percentage&quot;, 5) . name percentage . 0 Tools | 8.449910 | . 1 Entertainment | 6.069495 | . 2 Education | 5.347473 | . 3 Business | 4.591606 | . 4 Productivity | 3.892148 | . bar_n( google_genres, &quot;Top 10 Most Common Genres of Android Apps&quot;, &quot;Percentage of Apps&quot;, ) . There are 114 genres in this table, so it is not fully displayed. However, it would appear that the top 5 genres are Tools (8%), Entertainment, Education, Business, and Lifestyle. Like with the categories, practical apps are very common. . However, I noticed something special about this frequency table. Some genres are actually combinations of multiple genres, separated by semi-colons. If I can extract and count individual genres from these combined genres, then I can get a more accurate idea of app genres in the Google Play Store. . Note: This frequency table will show numbers instead of percentages. Since the genres overlap, the percentages would add up to greater than 100%. . freq = {} for value in android_clean[&quot;Genres&quot;]: genres = value.split(&quot;;&quot;) for genre in genres: freq.setdefault(genre, 0) freq[genre] += 1 google_genres_split = pd.Series(freq).sort_values(ascending = False) sr_to_df(google_genres_split, n_head = 5) . name number . 0 Tools | 750 | . 1 Education | 606 | . 2 Entertainment | 569 | . 3 Business | 407 | . 4 Lifestyle | 347 | . bar_n( google_genres_split, &quot;Top 10 Most Common Genres of Android Apps (Split Up)&quot;, &quot;Number of Apps&quot;, ) . It can be seen that the frequency table has slightly different placements now. However, the top genres are still Tools, Education, Entertainment, Business, and Lifestyle. Practical app genres are very common in the Google Play Store. They are more common here than in the Apple App Store. . Important: Based on the results, the Google Play Store has a selection of apps that is more balanced between entertainment and practicality. . . Going back to the the frequency table of Categories, since it seems that each Category represents a group of Genres. For example, one would expect apps in the Simulation, Arcade, Puzzle, Strategy, etc. genres to be under the Game category. It was shown earlier that this category is the 2nd most common in the Google Play Store. . The Categories column is more general and gives a more accurate picture of the common types of apps. Thus, from here on, I will be analyzing only the &quot;Category&quot; column and not the &quot;Genres&quot; column. . Note: I will now use &quot;app type&quot; to generally refer to the Apple App Store&#8217;s &quot;prime_genre&quot; values or the Google Play Store&#8217;s &quot;Category&quot; values. . App Types by Number of Users . We first looked at app types in terms of how common they are in the two app markets. Now, we shall see how many users there are for each app type. . Apple App Store: Rating Counts . In the Apple App Store dataset, there is no column that indicates the number of users. . print(list(ios_clean.columns)) . [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;track_name&#39;, &#39;size_bytes&#39;, &#39;currency&#39;, &#39;price&#39;, &#39;rating_count_tot&#39;, &#39;rating_count_ver&#39;, &#39;user_rating&#39;, &#39;user_rating_ver&#39;, &#39;ver&#39;, &#39;cont_rating&#39;, &#39;prime_genre&#39;, &#39;sup_devices.num&#39;, &#39;ipadSc_urls.num&#39;, &#39;lang.num&#39;, &#39;vpp_lic&#39;] . However, the &quot;rating_count_tot&quot; column exists. It indicates the total number of ratings given to each app. We can use it as a proxy for the number of users of each app. . The function below will return a Series showing the average number of users per app within each type. (Not the total number of users per type.) . def users_by_type(df, type_col, users_col, moct = &quot;mean&quot;): &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a Series that maps each app type to the average number of users per app for that type. Specify &#39;mean&#39; or &#39;median&#39; for the measure of central tendency.&quot;&quot;&quot; dct = {} for index, row in df.iterrows(): app_type = row[type_col] users = row[users_col] dct.setdefault(app_type, []).append(users) dct2 = {} for app_type in dct: counts = dct[app_type] if moct == &quot;mean&quot;: dct2[app_type] = np.mean(counts) elif moct == &quot;median&quot;: dct2[app_type] = np.median(counts) result = pd.Series(dct2).sort_values(ascending = False) return result ios_users = users_by_type(ios_clean, &quot;prime_genre&quot;, &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;) sr_to_df(ios_users, n_head = 5) . name number . 0 Navigation | 86090.333333 | . 1 Reference | 74942.111111 | . 2 Social Networking | 71548.349057 | . 3 Music | 57326.530303 | . 4 Weather | 52279.892857 | . bar_n( ios_users, &quot;Top 10 Most Popular iOS App Types&quot;, &quot;Mean Number of Users per App&quot;, ) . The top 5 iOS app types with the highest mean average number of users per app are Navigation, Reference, Social Networking, Music, and Weather. . However, these mean averages may be skewed by a few particularly popular apps. For example, let us look at the number of users of the top 5 Navigation apps. . ios_nav = ios_clean[[ &quot;track_name&quot;, &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;, ]].loc[ ios_clean[&quot;prime_genre&quot;] == &quot;Navigation&quot; ].sort_values( by = &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;, ascending = False, ).set_index( &quot;track_name&quot;, ) # `ios_nav` is still a DataFrame at this point. # It becomes a Series below. ios_nav = ios_nav[&quot;rating_count_tot&quot;] sr_to_df(ios_nav, n_head = 5) . track_name number . 0 Waze - GPS Navigation, Maps &amp; Real-time Traffic | 345046 | . 1 Google Maps - Navigation &amp; Transit | 154911 | . 2 Geocaching® | 12811 | . 3 CoPilot GPS – Car Navigation &amp; Offline Maps | 3582 | . 4 ImmobilienScout24: Real Estate Search in Germany | 187 | . bar_n( ios_nav, &quot;iOS Navigation Apps by Popularity&quot;, &quot;Number of Users&quot;, ) . Clearly, the distribution is skewed because Waze has such a high number of users. Therefore, a better measure of central tendency to use would be the median, not the mean. . Let us repeat the analysis using the median this time: . ios_users = users_by_type( ios_clean, &quot;prime_genre&quot;, &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;, moct = &quot;median&quot;, ) sr_to_df(ios_users, n_head = 5) . name number . 0 Productivity | 8737.5 | . 1 Navigation | 8196.5 | . 2 Reference | 6614.0 | . 3 Shopping | 5936.0 | . 4 Social Networking | 4199.0 | . bar_n( ios_users, &quot;Top 10 Most Popular iOS App Types&quot;, &quot;Median Number of Users per App&quot;, ) . The top 5 most popular iOS apps by median number of users per app are: . Productivity | Navigation | Reference | Shopping | Social Networking | . These placements are quite different from the top 5 most common iOS apps (Games, Entertainment, Photo &amp; Video, Education, and Social Networking). . . . Important: We can say the following about the Apple App Store. . Apps for entertainment and fun, notably Games, are the most common apps. | Apps for practical purposes, notably Productivity, are the most popular apps. | . Google Play Store: Installs . Let us see which columns in the Google Play Store dataset can tell us about the number of users per app. . android_clean.head() .

Let us now see which app categories are most popular. We will use the median average here, as we did for iOS apps. . android_users = users_by_type( android_clean, &quot;Category&quot;, &quot;Installs&quot;, moct = &quot;median&quot;, ) sr_to_df(android_users, n_head = 10) . name number . 0 ENTERTAINMENT | 1000000.0 | . 1 EDUCATION | 1000000.0 | . 2 GAME | 1000000.0 | . 3 PHOTOGRAPHY | 1000000.0 | . 4 SHOPPING | 1000000.0 | . 5 WEATHER | 1000000.0 | . 6 VIDEO_PLAYERS | 1000000.0 | . 7 COMMUNICATION | 500000.0 | . 8 FOOD_AND_DRINK | 500000.0 | . 9 HEALTH_AND_FITNESS | 500000.0 | . bar_n( android_users, &quot;Top 10 Most Popular Android App Types&quot;, &quot;Median Number of Users per App&quot;, n = 10, ) . Since the top 5 spots all had the same median number of users per app (1000000), the graph was expanded to include the top 10 spots. . It appears that the types of Android apps with the highest median number of users per app are: . GAME | VIDEO_PLAYERS | WEATHER | EDUCATION | ENTERTAINMENT | PHOTOGRAPHY | SHOPPING | . . . Important: We can say the following about the Google Play Store. . Both fun apps and practical apps are very common. | The most popular apps are also a mix of fun apps and practical apps. | . App Profile Ideas . Based on the results, we can now determine a profitable app profile for the hypothetical app company. . Here is a summary of the findings on the 2 app stores. . The Google Play Store has a balanced mix of fun and practical apps, so we can pick either kind. | On the other hand, the Apple App Store appears to be oversaturated with game apps, and practical apps are more popular. | . Therefore, in order to get the most users, the app company can set themselves apart in the Apple App Store by developing a useful practical app. . The most popular types of practical apps for the Apple App Store would be: . Productivity | Navigation | Reference | Shopping | . For the Google Play Store, these would be: . Weather | Education | Photography | Shopping | . Shopping appears in both lists, so it may be the most profitable type of app. However, the app company would have to make a unique app that has an edge over existing popular shopping apps. The same would apply for making a navigation app. . Considering that Reference and Education apps are popular, perhaps these two types could be combined into one app. First, let us find out the titles of the most popular apps in these genres. . reference_popularity = ios_clean[[ &quot;track_name&quot;, &quot;rating_count_tot&quot; ]].loc[ ios_clean[&quot;prime_genre&quot;] == &quot;Reference&quot; ].dropna( ).sort_values( &quot;rating_count_tot&quot;, ascending = False, ).set_index( &quot;track_name&quot;, )[&quot;rating_count_tot&quot;] sr_to_df(reference_popularity, n_head = 10) . track_name number . 0 Bible | 985920 | . 1 Dictionary.com Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus | 200047 | . 2 Dictionary.com Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus for iPad | 54175 | . 3 Google Translate | 26786 | . 4 Muslim Pro: Ramadan 2017 Prayer Times, Azan, Q... | 18418 | . 5 New Furniture Mods - Pocket Wiki &amp; Game Tools ... | 17588 | . 6 Merriam-Webster Dictionary | 16849 | . 7 Night Sky | 12122 | . 8 City Maps for Minecraft PE - The Best Maps for... | 8535 | . 9 LUCKY BLOCK MOD ™ for Minecraft PC Edition - T... | 4693 | . bar_n( reference_popularity, &quot;Top 10 Most Popular iOS Reference Apps&quot;, &quot;Number of Users&quot;, ) . education_popularity = android_clean[[ &quot;App&quot;, &quot;Installs&quot; ]].loc[ android_clean[&quot;Category&quot;] == &quot;EDUCATION&quot; ].dropna( ).sort_values( &quot;Installs&quot;, ascending = False, ).set_index( &quot;App&quot;, )[&quot;Installs&quot;] sr_to_df(education_popularity, n_head = 5) . App number . 0 Quizlet: Learn Languages &amp; Vocab with Flashcards | 10000000 | . 1 Learn languages, grammar &amp; vocabulary with Mem... | 10000000 | . 2 Learn English with Wlingua | 10000000 | . 3 Remind: School Communication | 10000000 | . 4 Math Tricks | 10000000 | . bar_n( education_popularity, &quot;Top 10 Most Popular Android Education Apps&quot;, &quot;Number of Users&quot;, ) . The most popular Reference apps are the Bible and some dictionary and translation apps. The most popular Education apps teach languages (especially English), or Math. . Therefore, the following are some ideas of a profitable app: . An app containing the Bible, another religious text, or another well-known text. The app can additionally include reflections, analyses, or quizzes about the text. | An app that contains an English dictionary, a translator, and some quick guides on English vocabulary and grammar. An app like the above, but for a different language that is spoken by many people. | . | An app that teaches English and Math lessons. Perhaps it could be marketed as a practice app for an entrance exam. | . Conclusion . In this project, we analyzed app data from a Google Play Store dataset and an Apple App Store dataset. Apps were limited to free apps targeted towards English speakers, because the hypothetical app company makes these kinds of apps. The most common and popular app genres were determined. . In the end, several ideas of profitable apps were listed. The app company may now review the analysis and consider the suggestions. This may help them make an informed, data-driven decision regarding the next app that they will develop. .",

I am interested in pursuing a college degree and career in Data Science. Other than this, my interests also include anime and archery. . . Contact . Email: migs.germar@gmail.com . Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/miguelantonio.germar/ . Github: https://github.com/MiguelAHG . My Learning Journey . I set up this website using fastpages as a blog and portfolio for Data Science projects. Below, I outline my learning journey in Data Science. Eventually, I will make blog posts about most of the projects that I have done along the way. . How I started in Data Science . I first found out about data science in 2020, around the time that the COVID-19 pandemic started. I decided to take online courses about data science in the summer, in order to see if it was interesting. First, I took the Python Core, Data Science, and Machine learning courses on Sololearn. . Here, I learned basic skills in the following: . Python | Spyder IDE | Jupyter Noteboook | Numpy | Pandas | Matplotlib | Scikit-learn | SQL basics | . Data Science in Practical Research . When classes started again, I prioritized schoolwork. However, I was able to apply my data science skills in my group’s Practical Research project. Our research paper was entitled “The Effect of COVID-19’s Consequences on Philippine Frontliners on their Mental Health: A Descriptive, Correlational Study.” We collected survey responses from 196 frontliners. I wrote the entire analysis in Python, from data cleaning to transformation to modeling. . I had to learn new things in order to do this, including: . Statsmodels | Dummy-coding categorical variables | Multiple linear regression | Testing the assumptions of OLS regression | Interpreting model results | . The Present: Summer of 2021 . Currently, I am working on the Data Scientist in Python course on Dataquest. The course includes many guided projects in Jupyter Notebook, and I will post each project on my blog as I go along. . .",
