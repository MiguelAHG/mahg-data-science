I am Miguel Antonio H. Germar, but you can call me Migs. I am currently a high school student in the Philippines. I am interested in pursuing a college degree and career in Data Science. Other than this, my interests also include anime and archery.

# My Learning Journey

I set up this website using [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) as a blog and portfolio for Data Science projects. Below, I outline my learning journey in Data Science. Eventually, I will make blog posts about most of the projects that I have done along the way.

## How I started in Data Science

I first found out about data science in 2020, around the time that the COVID-19 pandemic started. I decided to take online courses about data science in the summer, in order to see if it was interesting. First, I took the Python Core, Data Science, and Machine learning courses on [Sololearn](https://sololearn.com).

Here, I learned basic skills in the following:

- Python
- Spyder IDE
- Jupyter Noteboook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- SQL basics

## Data Science in Practical Research

When classes started again, I prioritized schoolwork. However, I was able to apply my data science skills in my group's Practical Research project. Our research paper was entitled "The Effect of COVID-19's Consequences on Philippine Frontliners on their Mental Health: A Descriptive, Correlational Study." We collected survey responses from 196 frontliners. I wrote the entire analysis in Python, from data cleaning to transformation to modeling.

I had to learn new things in order to do this, including:

- Statsmodels
- Dummy-coding categorical variables
- Multiple linear regression
- Testing the assumptions of OLS regression
- Interpreting and reporting p-values

## The Present: Summer of 2021

Currently, I am working on the Data Scientist in Python course on [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io). The course includes many guided projects in Jupyter Notebook, and I will post each project on my blog as I go along.

I also aim to complete a few courses in the Data Scientist pathway of [DOST's Sparta project](https://sparta.dap.edu.ph/), for the sake of learning theory and concepts.
