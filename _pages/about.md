# My Learning Journey

I set up this website using [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) as a blog and portfolio for Data Science projects. Below, I outline my learning journey in Data Science.

## How I started in Data Science

I first found out about data science in 2020, around the time that the COVID-19 pandemic started. I decided to take online courses about data science in the summer, in order to see if it was interesting. First, I took the Python Core, Data Science, and Machine learning courses on [Sololearn](https://sololearn.com).

Here, I learned basic skills in the following:

- Python
- Spyder IDE
- Jupyter Noteboook
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- SQL basics

## Data Science in Practical Research

When classes started again, I prioritized schoolwork. However, I was able to apply my data science skills in my group's Practical Research project. Our research paper was entitled "The Effect of COVID-19's Consequences on Philippine Frontliners on their Mental Health: A Descriptive, Correlational Study." We collected survey responses from 196 frontliners. I wrote the entire analysis in Python, from data cleaning to transformation to modeling.

I had to learn new things in order to do this, including:

- Statsmodels
- Dummy-coding categorical variables
- Multiple linear regression
- Testing the assumptions of OLS regression
- Interpreting model results

## Dataquest Online Platform

In April of 2022, I completed the Data Scientist in Python track on [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io). The courses included many guided projects in Jupyter Notebook, some of which have been posted on my blog.

I plan to continue studying Dataquest's other courses, such as Data Engineer in Python, and the Power BI skill path.
