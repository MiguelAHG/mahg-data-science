I am Miguel Antonio H. Germar, but you can call me Migs. I am currently a high school student from Quezon City, Philippines. I am interested in pursuing a college degree and career in Data Science. I set up this website using [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) as a blog and portfolio for my projects.
