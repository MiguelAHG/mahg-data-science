We disseminated a survey where students could input their college choices. For each college, they would tell us the college location, the interests (like STEM-oriented, ABM-oriented, etc.) related to their chosen courses, and the characteristics of the college that most influenced their choice to apply. Then, I cleaned the data and visualized it in the College Applications Dashboard.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/images/markdown-images/dac-college-apps-dashboard/overview-page-characteristics-graph.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/images/markdown-images/dac-college-apps-dashboard/overview-page-characteristics-graph.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ASHS Student Mapping Project: A Tool for Disaster Risk Reduction in the Online Set-up</title><link href="https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/ashs-student-mapping-project" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ASHS Student Mapping Project: A Tool for Disaster Risk Reduction in the Online Set-up" /><published>2022-05-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/Student-Mapping-Project</id><author><name>Migs Germar</name></author><category term="python" /><category term="streamlit" /><category term="school-project" /><summary type="html">In senior high school, I was a member of the ASHS Programming Varsity (ProgVar). Sometime in Grade 12, the ProgVar officers and I were approached by the Office of the Assistant Principal for Administration with a request to develop an app that would help identify students affected by natural hazards, especially adverse weather conditions like typhoons. I rose to the challenge and proposed the Student Mapping Project. Throughout several months, I used my free time to set up a database of student locations and develop a web app. This app can take a list of affected areas and generate a list of students who live in those areas, as well as a map showing their geographic distribution.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/images/markdown-images/progvar-student-mapping-project/sample-map-metro-manila.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://miguelahg.github.io/mahg-data-science/images/markdown-images/progvar-student-mapping-project/sample-map-metro-manila.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
